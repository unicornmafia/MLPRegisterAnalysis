[Truly] We've gotta get these banners and bows and balloons and things up!

[Paradise] You're certainly on cloud nine today, Truly.

[Truly] But of course, Paradise! The Big Brother Ponies are comin' home!

[Paradise] Gee, what if the Big Brothers don't make it on time?

[Posey] Who knows what might have happened to them? And a year's an awfully long time..

[Lofty] You're speaking of the Big Brothers! They'll be here alright! And they'll be on time.

[Surprise]  Surprise!!
           Hiya Buttons! Wasn't that a good surprise?

[Buttons]  Uh, sure! Now help me replace all these 'surprise' balloons!
          Do you hear something..? 

[Somnambula] A bit louder, perhaps..

[Paradise] It sounds like a circus!

[Somnambula] Now, Kyrie, sing!

[Kyrie]  No, Somnambula, please, don't make me!

[Somnambula] SING!

[Paradise]  Let's see what it is..

[Spike] Paradise! What are you doing?!
        You- aaoh!

[Lofty] But the party!  Oh well, it doesn't matter..

[Spike] No- Lofty! You can't! The party!
        Everybody! PLEASE don't do this! 

[Truly] We're gonna play this when the Big Brothers cross the finish line, so get it right!

[Baby Lofty] You hear somethin'?

[Truly] I surely do - I hear the sound of y'all not playin'!

[Somnambula] That's enough, Kyrie.
             Ah, I feel..
             ..better already.  Welcome.

[Paradise]  We thought we heard.. a circus.

[Somnambula] And so you did.
             We can go there if you like
             All you have to do is follow me

[Quarterback] Fourth down and five yards to go, Steamer! We're almost home!

[Steamer] Yeah, and I'm gonna ride all over your rails at the finish line, Score!

[4-Speed] Ah, just think, Salty! In a few moments, we'll see Paradise Estate again! Ah, after all 
          this time..

[Salty]  Aye, matey! We'll hoist our jim and lay ha-hard into port!

[4-Speed]  Uh... right.

[Tex] Reckon you're lookin' forward to seein' them  lil' fillies when we get home, eh Slugger?

[Slugger]  Yep.

[Tex] Especially that there Buttons, huh?

[Slugger]  Yep..

[Tex] Hm.. sure hope she can improve your talkin' abilities some!
      Yee-haw! Gonna bust your chops, Score!

[Quarterback] It ain't a touchdown 'til you pass the goalpost, Tex!

[Salty] Ho-ho-ho, blow me down!

[Slugger] Where IS everybody?

[Tex] Maybe they forgot we was comin'?

[4-Speed] Ah, not the Little Ponies!

[Slugger] N-not Buttons!

[Steamer] They'd never forget!

[Quarterback]  I've got it! This is all a gag! All we gotta do is walk through
              that door, and they'll all jump out yelling "surprise!".

[Tex] It's the Big Brothers y'all!

[4-Speed] Ah, you can jump out and surprise us now

[Quarterback] Anybody home?

[Salty]  Ahoy?

[Quarterback]  There is something seriously wrong here.
              Who could imagine we'd return after all this time to find Paradise Estate abandoned? 
              Devoid of life? Silent!

[Truly] You're here!

[Baby Cuddles] You're here!

[Spike] Hooray!

[Baby Cuddles] Me hap-py!

[Quarterback] What happened to everybody?

[Spike] They heard the sound of a circus!

[Truly] And they all just up and left!

[Spike] Like they were in some kind of trance or something! I heard it, but it didn't bother me.

[Baby Lofty] Me heard it too, but no make me go.

[Quarterback] Hm. It sounds like it affects JUST the Little Ponies, and not the babies!

[Spike] And not baby dragons!

[4-Speed] What d'you think we should do?

[Quarterback] I think Truly and the others should wait here!  While we go find 'em!

[Baby Heart Throb] They're just so dashing.

[Spike] And brave.

[Truly] Oh, I do hope they can rescue the others..

[Somnambula] Ah.. I can feel my powers increasing already!
             Now I can make all this real!

[Ringleader] Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, here it is! The wonder kitchen, bake to your heart's content!
             Step right up, folks! The gardener's delight! 

[Posey] Oh boy, seeds!

[Ringleader] Ice cream, ladies and gents! All you can eat!

[Lickety-Split] I'll have one of each!

[Steamer] We've been following the Ponies' tracks all day without a sign of 'em!

[Quarterback] And it's getting dark! We're gonna have to bed down soon.

[Slugger] N-no! We keep searching!

[Tex] No way, Slugger! Why, in five minutes, you won't be able to see your own nose!

[Somnambula] Now, Kyrie - sing for me!

[Kyrie] No, Somnambula! It's not right!

[Somnambula] I have the power to make my illusions real now!

[Kyrie] Uh- ah- alright, alright!

[Spike] TRULY!
        Come on! We've gotta stop her!
        Hurry! Oh, Truly, wake up!
        Oh no!

[Baby Heart Throb] Not Big Brothers too!

[Spike] We gotta break their trance somehow!
        Oh, I hate to do this, but.. LET 'EM HAVE IT!

[Tex]  What in the sam hill..?

[Quarterback] What're we doin' here?

[Steamer] Somebody knocked us off the tracks!

[Spike] It was us!

[Tex] What's that singin'?

[Baby Heart Throb] It's funny singing!

[Baby Lofty] It makes all the grown-up ponies act strange! Even Big Brothers, like they walkin' in sleep!

[Steamer] Where's it coming from?

[Quarterback]  Right there!

[Steamer] Slugger! What're you doing?!

[Tex] Truly!

[Baby Ponies] Ah! Oh, !

[Spike] Come back!!

[4-Speed] Ah, you okay good buddy?

[Slugger] Yep, I-I think so..

[Quarterback]  THAT'S where we've gotta go!

[Tex] Looks a mite dangerous, Score.

[Quarterback] That's where the Little Ponies are, Tex.

[Slugger] That's where Buttons is!

[Quarterback] Then that's where we're gonna go!

[Tex]  Now, you lil' 'uns head back up to the hills and stay safe!

[Quarterback]  Come on, let's see some teamwork!
              Now that's what I call teamwork!

[Tex]  Boy howdy..

[4-Speed] I'm beginnin' to understand why all the Little Ponies left home!

[Quarterback] Maybe. But there's something weird about all this.
              Truly! Hey, c'mere, we wanna talk to ya!
              Well how d'you like that?

[Salty]  Lickety-Split?

[Tex] It's us! It's the Big Brother Ponies!

[Lickety-Split] Not now, I've gotta get some more ice cream!

[Quarterback] Heart Throb!

[Heart Throb] No! I am Salome, one of the most famous lovers in history!

[4-Speed] Heart Throb, don't you recognize us?

[Heart Throb] Go away, you're spoiling my performance!

[Quarterback] No! You're gonna listen to us!
              Heart Throb.. you're so old!

[Heart Throb] I feel fine! Now get out of here!  I want to be alone.

[Quarterback]  Gingerbread!

[Slugger] I just gotta find Buttons - I gotta know if she's okay!

[Tex] That gal's face looked like 40 miles of bad road!

[Salty] Something is not altogether ship-shape here!

[Quarterback] I'll say! We've got to get them out of here now. And we can't let anything stop us!

[Big Brothers] Woah!

[4-Speed]  Well shift my gears!

[Tex] Woah, what a spread!

[Salty] Ho-ho-ho, blow me down!

[Quarterback] Now who could've known that football is my game?

[Salty] Aye, and there's the fine ship I've always wanted!

[Quarterback] Wait a minute, guys! This isn't right! It's too perfect!

[Steamer]  Yeah, ain't it just?

[Somnambula] So, they won't play, eh?

[Kyrie] No! No, don't make me do it Somnambula! What you're doing is evil!

[Somnambula] I have my youth back - I have my new powers! YOU don't think I'm going to stop now, do you?!
             Now, sing!

[Quarterback] No! Don't listen to it..!

[Steamer] All aboard!

[Tex] Yee-haw, it's round-up time!

[4-Speed] Let's burn rubber!

[Salty] All power back, full speed ahead!

[Slugger] Batter up!
 Explaining sports

[Quarterback] It's a  run! He's on the 50, the 40, the 30!

[Kyrie] I've got to get out of here! I've just got to!
        Gotta get out! Gotta get out! Go-  I am out!

[Baby Heart Throb]  Hey, look!

[Baby Lofty?] Hey!

[Spike] Over here!

[Baby ponies] There she is, here, here!

[Kyrie] What d'you want?

[Spike] Have you seen the ponies?

[Kyrie] They're in there, and they're all playing!

[Baby Heart Throb] What?

[Kyrie] Somnambula made me sing them into a trance.

[Baby Lofty] Who's So'nambula?

[Kyrie]  She's an awful witch, who takes youth for herself and only gives back age.

[Spike] Y-you put them in a trance?!

[Baby Lofty] Can you put them out of it?

[Kyrie] Well, I suppose I could sing a different song, but I'm not going back there! I'm not going anywhere near Somnambula
        again!

[Spike] But you have to help us!

[Baby Cuddles] Please!

[Baby Lofty] Help rescue our friends!

[Baby Cuddles, Baby Lofty and Spike] Help us! Please!

[Kyrie]  Okay.. I'll help. Will you come with me?

[Baby ponies and Spike] YES!

[Spike] Okay, no one's around!

[Kyrie] Cover your ears!

[Quarterback] The Ponies!  Got to help them!

[4-Speed]  What am I doin'?!

[Truly] You came, you rescued us!

[Heart Throb] Our heroes!

[Gingerbread] But what's happened to us? We're so old..

[Slugger] Where's Buttons? I can't find her!

[4-Speed] Yeah, I haven't seen ANY of the unicorns!

[Somnambula] And you won't, either!

[Quarterback] 4-Speed, Slugger, come with me! The rest of you - protect the Little Ponies! 
               And bring that bird!

[Tex]  You heard 'im! Let's get down to business!
       YEE-HAW!

[Quarterback] Let's break it down!
              ..Let's try again.

[Gingerbread house] Now you'll know what it's like to have someone gnawin' on you!

[Gingerbread house] Hey, watch where you're goin'!

[4-Speed] This is gettin' us nowhere!

[Quarterback] We've got to get it open! Remember Slugger - Buttons is probably on the other side!

[4-Speed] It's like all their magic powers are being sucked into that crystal!

[Kyrie] So.. that's it! Somnambula's been getting her youth from the other ponies, and her new powers from the unicorns!

[Somnambula] Quite right, Kyrie!
             And I've no intention of giving them up!

[Tex] Woohoo!

[Quarterback] Sing, Kyrie - wake the unicorns up!

[Somnambula] But - she can't~!

[Slugger] T-then, I'll stop you myself!

[Somnambula] Ah - but you won't.

[Slugger] Buttons! 

[Somnambula]  NO!
             NO!!
             No..!
             No, no!!

[Tex] Well, tie me up and brand me! Y'all's young again!

[Quarterback] And everybody's safe and sound.

[Steamer] What about Slugger?

[Gingerbread] And Buttons?

[Quarterback] Don't worry! They're the safest and soundest of any of us!

[Salty] Let's hard a-port  and set sail for safe dry-dock!

[Tex] I've got a better idea, Salty - let's go home instead?
