CAST (in order of appearance)
Valentine - earth pony, yellow-orange body  w/ orange hair. Seems to be a fictional character in-universe.
Valentine's friend - earth pony, light blue body w/ light blonde hair and grey hooves. He wears a grey 
                     bandana. Seems to be a fictional character in-universe. Valentine's friend's 
                     design is clearly based off the Big Brother Ponies; he is actually the first 
                     boy pony to appear in the cartoons :).
Paradise - pegasus, white body w/ dark orange hair, symbol is two palm trees under a crescent moon
Wind Whistler - pegasus, light blue body w/ light pink hair, symbol is several pink and blue whistles.
Truly - earth pony, white body w/ pink hair, symbol is a dark blue dove + pink hearts
Gusty - unicorn, white body, blue-green hair w/ pink streak, symbol is several maple leaves
Buttons - unicorn, light pink body, blue hair w/ red streaks, symbol is several red buttons surrounded by three blue stars
Baby Ribbon - unicorn, blue body, dull green hair w/ orange streak, symbol is a white ribbon
Baby Buttons - unicorn, light pink body, blue hair w/ red streaks, symbol is several red buttons surrounded by two blue stars
Baby Heart Throb - pegasus, pink body w/ dark pink hair, symbol is two pink hearts w/ white wings
Megan - an ordinary human girl, with long blonde hair tied back in a ribbon
Danny - an ordinary human boy, with short, red hair and a baseball cap; Megan's younger brother
The Bushwoolies - multicoloured little fuzzy creatures that agree with everything
Crunch the Rockdog - this episode's villain: a bulldog made out of rocks, who hates anything soft and nice.
Purple Bushwoolie - a purple Bushwoolie. (Well, what did you expect? :P)
The Moochick - a dwarf-like person who has magical powers.
Habbit - The Moochick's companion; a cute little brown rabbit, who can't talk.. 
         which is unfortunate, since he's a little more competent than the Moochick 
         himself :P.
         (Note that, for whatever reason, he was drawn with white fur in this episode.)
His Elevated Eminence - a living, sentient mountain

** As with all of my transcripts, this is not intended to be a replacement for watching 
the episode itself, it's more for quoting purposes, easily checking lines without having to 
search through the episode for them, etc. **

Notes: 
- There is a rather confusing animation error at the beginning of this episode. The 
  dialogue for Paradise's story says that Valentine was the one who stayed, and her friend 
  left, however, the animation shows the opposite. I'm guessing what happened is that their 
  model sheets got mixed up during production of this episode. Either way, for this transcript I 
  chose to list Valentine as the female, orange pony (the one that leaves), and her friend as the 
  light blue, male pony (the one that stays). :)
- Baby Buttons' appearance in this episode is interesting, as she was never released in the USA! 
  And yet, it is clearly meant to be her. I'm inclined to believe that her appearance in this episode 
  is simply due to another animation error (it wouldn't be the first time - a baby version of Wind 
  Whistler appears near the end of "My Little Pony: The Movie", for example), but it's still interesting, 
  isn't it? :3 

------------

(The episode begins with two ponies running in a desert-type landscape, away from a dust cloud of some sort. 
 They come to a dead end. The ponies - a girl and boy - nuzzle each other, and exchange glances; the boy 
 appears to be convincing his girlfriend to save herself. She runs, leaving him behind.)

[Paradise] (voice-over) "As Valentine watched her friend gallop away into the darkening sunset, a single lonely 
                         tear rolled down her face.."

(Cut away to reveal Paradise is telling a story to the other Little Ponies, Megan, and Danny.)

[Paradise] "..The End."

(The baby ponies start sobbing.)

[Wind Whistler] (to Paradise) Why would Valentine's friend gallop away at sunset?
[Paradise] (sniffling) ..huh?
[Wind Whistler] It is illogical to begin a long journey just as the sun is setting.
[Truly] (annoyed) Who /cares/ what the sun was doing when he had to leave his one true love?!
[Gusty] (also annoyed) Yeah, how can you ask a question like that at a time like this?
[Wind Whistler] Time like what?
(Truly, Buttons and Gusty groan exasperatedly.)
(The Baby Ponies continue to sob; Buttons, Truly and Gusty walk over and comfort them.)

[Wind Whistler] I fail to understand this display of sentiment! It /is/ just a story, 
                after all.
[Gusty] Wind Whistler, it's too bad you weren't around when the Feelings Fairy was passing out 
        feelings!
[Buttons] (laughs)
[Wind Whistler] (hurt) I /do/ have feelings..
(Megan stands up, glaring at Buttons and Gusty.)
[Megan] Which I think you two just proved.
[Danny] Yeah, by hurting 'em.
(Megan and Danny walk away.)
[Gusty] Way to go, Buttons.
[Buttons] Moi?
(They both laugh.)

~~~

(The Bushwoolies are swimming frantically through a river.)

[Blue Bushwoolie] LOOK OUT! Crunch the Rockdog comin'! Run for your lives!
[Bushwoolies] Yeah, run for your lives! Run! Yeah, run, run! (etc)
(They all crash into each other.)
[Bushwoolies] Ow! I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry! It's okay! I'm glad you're sorry. (etc)
[Blue Bushwoolie] Let's go left!
[Bushwoolies] Right! Yeah, right left! Right left!
[Blue Bushwoolie] That's it, take it to the left! 
[Bushwoolie #2] Right!

(We see a bunch of rock.. things with faces speeding after the Bushwoolies, growling like dogs, 
 followed by a huge Rockdog - Crunch. As he walks after them, everything he touches turns into 
 stone. His voice is very deep and gravelly [no pun intended ;p].)

(And thus we have this episode's first song, "I Hate Soft" - a villain song. During this song, 
 Crunch and the Rocklings are chasing after the Bushwoolies, as Crunch turns everything into 
 stone.)

[Crunch] ~ I hate soft!
           Anything that's soft and squishes
           Leaves me feeling mean and vicious!
           I HATE SOFT! (growls) I HATE SOFT!

           I HATE NICE! 
           Puffy clouds and puffy pillows..
           Sleeping lambs and weeping willows..
           Make me MAD! (stomps his paw down) Nice is BAD!

           (glares down at the Bushwoolies) 
           I hate sweet and cuddly things! Anything that's gentle!
           Don't give me no hearts and flowers, I ain't sentimental~!
           I hate soft!
           So don't get in /my/ way, cause if you do - 
           I will make life hard...
           for you! (evil laugh) ~

~~~ 

(Wind Whistler is alone; she walks through a field of flowers nearby Paradise Estate, 
 underneath the moonlight.)

[Wind Whistler] I /have/ feelings.. I merely refrain from expressing them at the drop of a hat.

(Megan and Danny rush over to her.)

[Megan] Don't feel bad, Wind Whistler.
[Danny] They didn't mean it.
[Purple Bushwoolie] HELP! HELP!! (panting) The Rockdog from the Purple Mountain, oh, it was horrible! 
(He crashes into a tree.)
                    Terrible, I tell ya! Turned to stone! (pants and wheezes) Made marshlands into rocky 
                    valley! 
(Megan picks him up and puts him down on the grass.)
                    Oh.. No more green, and.. and- and- and- and- and- Crunch the Rockdog turned Bushwoolies- 
                    turned Bushwoolies- to STONE! (faints)

(Gusty, Buttons and Truly are watching the spectacle through the windows of Paradise Estate.)

[Gusty] I'm gonna give that obnoxious rock-whatsit a piece of my mind!
(Truly withdraws her head from the windows, then looks out again, now wearing a rather fetching, flowery hat. :D)
[Truly] I can't go nowhere 'til I change into my travelling outfit! 

(Megan and Danny help the purple Bushwoolie to his feet.)

[Wind Whistler] Everyone! Please remain calm!
(Gusty, Buttons and Truly run outside, up to Wind Whistler.)
[Gusty] Calm? CALM?! Only someone with no feelings could remain calm at a time like this! 
[Wind Whistler] I meant that we need a plan of action.
[Megan] She's right!
[Wind Whistler] But we better find out what makes this Rockdog tick!
[Megan] And for that, we'll have to talk to the Moochick.

~~~

(The ponies, Megan, Danny and the Purple Bushwoolie go over to the Moochick's home, 
 the Mushromp. Danny is holding the Purple Bushwoolie on his shoulder.)

[Danny] (to the Purple Bushwoolie) Don't you worry, lil' fella. We won't let that 
        walking stalagmite hurt you.
[Purple Bushwoolie] (gasps)

(They reach the Moochick's front door, and knock on it. When there's no response, Megan opens 
 the door herself.)

[Megan] Hello? Mr. Moochick?
[The Moochick] Ooh- get it, ooh- ooh, no, no no no, ooh, no- no, that way-!

(He chases after a stick-type object, that has eyes and keeps bouncing around, trying 
 to get away from the Moochick.)

[Stick] (shrieks)

(Megan and Danny try to catch the stick, to no avail.)

[Megan] What's going on here, Mr. Moochick?
[The Moochick] AFTER IT~!
[Ponies] I'll get it! There it is! (etc)

(The stick hides under a stack of books.)

[Wind Whistler] That is a.. a very smart stick.
[The Moochick] Huh! /Too/ smart, if you ask me! Doesn't know its place!
(Danny leans down, looking under the stack of books.)
[Danny] Aha!
(He starts throwing books every-which-way; the stick appears, looking around worriedly.)
[Truly] Oh, he's scared!
[Wind Whistler] Yes, he certainly is!
[Megan] Aww, the poor little thing.
        (to the Moochick) Perhaps it feels unappreciated, or overworked?
[The Moochick] (taken aback) Unappreciated? Overworked?!
[Truly] Let it have some fun!
[Buttons] Yeah, let it have a day off!
[Wind Whistler] Let's do that.
[The Moochick] Well, alright! It can have a day off every time the mushrooms bloom. 

(The stick jumps out of the stack of books and bounces over to the Moochick.)
               Hah! Hm.. oh yes, yes, that is more like it.
(The Moochick turns to Megan, Danny and the Little Ponies.)
               Now, what are you folks doing here? 
[Megan] Have you heard of a Crunch the Rockdog? He comes from somewhere in the Purple Mountains.
[The Moochick] Oh, no no no, never heard of him. But! If he's from the Purple Mountains, then you should 
               talk to His Elevated Eminence, the Mountain King! Oh, just head for the Purple Mountains, 
               you can't miss it!
[Megan] Thank you, Mr. Moochick!
[The Moochick] At least, I /think/ it's His Elevated Eminence.. or is it His Royal Rockface..? Hm..

~~~

(Nearby the Purple Mountains, we see stone statues of the Bushwoolies; the Bushwoolies that didn't 
 manage to run away from Crunch.)

[Danny] This is bad, alright.
[Purple Bushwoolie] (whispering and pointing) Purple Mountain!
[Megan] So that's where we'll find His Elevated Eminence, huh? 

(A rumbling noise.)

[Gusty] What was that?
[Purple Bushwoolie] C-C-C-C-C-CRUNCH THE ROCKDOG!

(A pink Bushwoolie comes speeding into view, followed closely by Crunch.)

[Crunch] (roars)

(The Bushwoolie tries to hide behind one of the Rocklings, waking it up; it chases after the Bushwoolie. 
 The Purple Bushwoolie chases after Pink.)

[Purple Bushwoolie] Look out! Behind you!
(Danny and Megan chase after Purple Bushwoolie; Danny grabs hold of him.)
[Danny] No, lil' fella! Don't do it!
(Purple Bushwoolie wriggles out of his grasp, and rushes after its kin.)
[Purple Bushwoolie] (to the Pink Bushwoolie) Behind you, behind you!!
[Pink Bushwoolie] Behind me? Behind me?!
(They roll away.. right up to Crunch.)
[Crunch] Oh, look! (laughs) Two for the price of one!
[Purple Bushwoolie and Pink Bushwoolie] (scream)
(Crunch raises a paw.)
[Crunch] One...
(He taps the Pink Bushwoolie and turns it into stone.)
         Two.
(He then taps the Purple Bushwoolie, also turning it to stone.)
         (laughs)
[Ponies, Megan and Danny] (gasp)
[Danny] I can handle him!
[Megan] Danny, don't!
[Danny] It's just a dog! 
[Megan] (gasps)
[Wind Whistler] Oh no!
(Danny walks up to Crunch.)
[Danny] Hey, you!
(Crunch turns to face him.)
        Yeah, you! You fossilised mutt! You're a bad dog! BAD! Bad dog, sit! Sit!
[Crunch] (laughs)
[Danny] Heel, heel! You- you granite mongrel!
[Crunch] (continues to laugh)
[Danny] Heel, boy! Lie down! Down! 
[Truly] He's completely blown our cover!
[Wind Whistler] At this point, I fear our only recourse is to make a run for it.
[Megan] I think you're right.
[Crunch] (still laughing)
[Danny] What's so funny? 
[Megan] (grabs hold of her brother) C'mon, Danny!
[Crunch] (laughs) Heel! Sit! (laughs)
(Megan, Danny and the Little Ponies run off. Crunch realizes they're escaping and 
 sits up immediately.)
         (to the Rocklings) AFTER THEM!
(The Rocklings chase after them, as does Crunch. They close in on Gusty.)
[Gusty] Go on without me!
[Truly] Gusty! What in tarnation are you doin'?!
[Gusty] Go on! I've got an idea!
[Buttons] We're not leaving you!
[Gusty] I'll draw (?) them off, and catch up at the Mountains.
[Wind Whistler] Gusty, I must protest!

(Gusty winks out, and then back in again. The Rocklings get closer..)
[Gusty] Here's gust in your eye!
(She uses her unicorn magic to blow dust around.)
        See? I blind 'em with a small dust storm, and I'm outta here!
(The Rocklings continue to chase her, ignoring the dust.)
        Uh-oh... 
        (Nervously) Uh, come to think of it.. a little dust wouldn't have much 
        effect on rocks, would it..? 
(She tries to run and immediately runs into Crunch himself.)
[Crunch] Going somewhere?
[Gusty] (gulps)
[Crunch] (evil laugh) Good! Cause I'd like you to.. (laughs) ..stick around! (continues 
         laughing)

(He reaches down, and turns Gusty into stone. End part one.)

~~~

(Beginning of part two.)

[Crunch] (laughs)
[Crunch and the Rocklings] (still laughing)
[Megan, Danny, Wind Whistler and Buttons] GUSTY!
[Truly] That rock-thing's gonna be plum sorry he messed with our Gusty!
[Wind Whistler] She is beyond help. Logic clearly dictates that we save ourselves.
[Buttons] Gosh, Wind Whistler, how could you just go off and leave poor Gusty?
[Truly] What else would you expect from somebody with no feelings, Buttons?
[Megan] No, Truly, Wind Whistler's right, we've gotta go on without Gusty.
[Danny] Well, whatever we're gonna do, let's snap (?) it up!

(They notice the Rocklings and Crunch rushing up to them, and start running away. Truly 
 looks over her shoulder.)

[Truly] Bye-bye, Gusty! We'll be back!
[Megan] She knows, Truly. She knows.
(They come to the edge of the cliff; Danny nearly falls off.)
[Danny] Woah..!
[Rocklings] TRACK THEM! (?)
[Buttons] Y'know, Gusty was on the right track after all.
          (walks forward) This one's for you, Gusty!
[Truly] Buttons, don't!
[Buttons] (to the Rocklings) Betcha can't catch me~!
[Rocklings] Oh YEAH?! Another one!
(They rush forward; Buttons winks out.)
[Rocklings] Huh? Where'd she go?
(Buttons winks back in, behind the Rocklings.)
[Buttons] Yoo-hoo~! Over here~!
[Rocklings] Hey, there she is!
[Wind Whistler] She's drawing them off. To the Mountains, then, quickly!
(Buttons winks in and out again.)
[Buttons] (to the Rocklings) No, this way!
(She continues winking in and out, until the Rocklings are at the edge of the cliff. She uses 
 her unicorn magic to break the edge of the cliff, sending the Rocklings flying. They 
 land on top of Crunch.)

[Truly] Oh, I hope Buttons is okay!
[Buttons] Oh, I'm sure she's fine.
[Truly] (overjoyed) Buttons! Y'all did it!
[Buttons] It doesn't take much to outsmart a rock.

[Danny] Okay. Now all we have to do is find this Eminence guy.
[Megan] The Moochick said if we go to the Purple Mountains, we couldn't miss him.
(Shot of the Purple Mountains, which seem to have a face cut into the side of them..)
[His Elevated Eminence] Greetings!
(Megan, Danny and the Ponies all exchange glances.)
[Megan] Uh.. Excuse me, whoever you are, but do you know where we can find His Elevated Eminence?
[His Elevated Eminence] (laughs good-naturedly) You're standing on him!
[Wind Whistler] Remarkable! This entire mountain is a living, sentient being!
                (looks down) Greetings, Your Elevated Eminence!
[Megan] Uh.. yes, greetings, Your Eminence. We've come to ask for your help. You see, Crunch the Rock-
[His Elevated Eminence] Oh, Crunch! He is /definitely/ out of control. And it's all my fault! You see, I needed a guard to 
      protect the Hot Stone, which is the magical gem that gives me feelings.
      I created Crunch the Rockdog to protect the gem, but I neglected to put any heart into Crunch himself, 
      accidentally creating a cold, ferocious beast! But I discovered my mistake too late. To make him 
      indestructible, I had put a piece of Black Lava Rock, from the roiling depths of the Volcano of Gloom(/Doom), 
      into his collar. It gives Crunch the power to turn anything to stone! 
      There's only one thing powerful enough to defeat him - the Heart Stone! You must take it and stop Crunch!
[Megan] Well, I.. guess that doesn't sound so difficult. Where is the Heart Stone, anyway?
[His Elevated Eminence] Deep within me.
[Buttons] And, how do we, er, get there?
(Some rocks are cleared away from the front of a cave nearby, creating an opening.)
[His Elevated Eminence] I'll guide you. But, er.. I'm not exactly certain what will happen when the Heart Stone is removed.

(Inside the cave..)
[Danny] W-what could possibly happen?
[Megan] Which way?
[His Elevated Eminence] To the left.
(Megan, Danny and the Little Ponies.. go to the left. :B)
      One more jaunt to the right and you're there.

(They find the Heart Stone..)
[Buttons] It's beautiful!
[Wind Whistler] Take it, Megan.
(Megan walks up to the Heart Stone, which is glowing brightly.)
[Megan] Ooh.. Maybe I shouldn't.
[His Elevated Eminence] Go ahead, my dear.
(She takes the Heart Stone and walks back to the group.)
[Danny] Which way, Your Eminence?
[His Elevated Eminence] (screams)
[Buttons] Uh-oh!
(The whole mountain begins shaking.)
[Danny and Truly] (scream)
(The mountain continues to shake; Danny and Truly fall over, while Megan nearly drops the Heart Stone.)
[Wind Whistler] Careful, Megan!
[His Elevated Eminence] GIVE ME MY HEART STONE!
[Megan] What's the matter with him?!
[Wind Whistler] If His Eminence /gets/ his feelings from the Heart Stone..
[Danny] ..Then without it, he's turning into a major-league grouch!
(Rocks start falling quickly - an avalanche.)
        RUN!
[Megan] Hurry!
[Buttons] This way.
[Truly] Hurry!
[Buttons] This way!
[Buttons and Truly?] Come on, let's go!
[Megan] Go! That way!

(They escape from the cave, and just in time; as soon as they escape from the cave, rocks fall and block the 
 entrance once again.)
[Ponies, Megan and Danny] (coughing/spluttering)
[Truly] (coughs) Look!
[Crunch] (roars)
(Megan hides the Heart Stone behind her back.)
         I've found you! Who wants to be turned to stone first?
[Truly] You've gone too far this time, Rockdog. (rushes forward)
[Megan] No, Truly!
[Danny] No, Truly, don't go!
[Buttons] Stay here!
[Wind Whistler] Go ahead.
[Crunch] Huh? "Go ahead?"
[Danny] (to Wind Whistler) What are you talking about?
[Buttons] What's the matter with you?
[Truly] You really don't like anyone, do you?
[Wind Whistler] (to Crunch) I mean it! Go ahead! /I/ don't care what you do with her.
[Crunch] You're crazy if you think I'll buy that.
[Wind Whistler] I'm perfectly serious. I've been surrounded by these romantic idiots for so long, it is refreshing to find 
     one such as yourself.
[Buttons] Wind Whistler! How /could/ you?
[Wind Whistler] Pay no attention to them, Crunch!
[Crunch] You /really/ don't care what I do to her?
[Wind Whistler] That sentimental fool? Certainly not.
[Crunch] Good, cause I'm gonna turn her to stone!
(He puts his paw down on Truly, instantly turning her to stone; her hat, however, remains the same. A single tear runs 
 down Wind Whistler's face.)
         Haha! I thought so! You DO care, don't you?
(He walks towards the other ponies, Megan and Danny.)
[Wind Whistler] Wait! I'll /prove/ I'm on your side!
(She flies over to Megan.)
     By giving you your next victim! 
(Wind Whistler grabs hold of Megan by the back of her overalls, and flies her over to Crunch. Danny tries to catch 
 Wind Whistler, but fails.)
[Megan] (catching on) (whispers, to Wind Whistler) Yeah, that's it, Wind Whistler, bring me to him!
(Megan holds out the Heart Stone in front of her.)
[Crunch] The Heart Stone!
(He starts to run away; Wind Whistler drops Megan onto the ground, and she rushes after Crunch.)
[Megan] Please, Heart Stone, /do/ something!
(On cue, the Heart Stone starts glowing brightly, the light shooting out towards Crunch, who looks terrified and curls into a ball. 
 Well, as best as he can, considering he's, y'know, made of stone 'n all. :p The light hits his collar.)
[Crunch] NO!
(He shrinks in size until he's turned into a normal, tiny brown Bulldog puppy.)
         (yaps)
(Truly turns back to normal.)
[Buttons] It worked!
[Megan] She's alright!!
[Buttons, Megan and Danny] (cheer)
(Gusty runs over to the group.)
[Gusty] Hey you guys, look, it's me!
[Danny] Hooray, it's Gusty!
[Megan and Truly] (cheer)
[Megan] I knew you wouldn't turn against us, Wind Whistler.

~~~

(Back at the river, we see the Bushwoolies, as well as the surrounding area, turn back to normal.)
[Bushwoolies] Yeah, yeah! We're okay, we're okay! Yeah, yeah, fine! I feel good!

~~~

(Back at the Purple Mountains..)

[Megan, Gusty, Buttons and Truly] Hooray! We found you! (etc)
(!Puppy!Crunch walks up to them, his voice now somewhat squeaky and basically completely unthreatening. XD)
[Megan, Gusty, Buttons and Truly] (laughing happily)
[Crunch] Stop laughing! Stop cheering! Why are you so happy? There's nothing to be happy about! Stop it or I'll 
         bite ya!
[Megan] I bet all he needs is a little heart.
[Danny] Yeah, then he'd be a nice puppy!
(Danny catches Crunch and holds him down, as Megan takes the Heart Stone over to Buttons. She uses her horn to break off 
 a tiny part of the stone.)
[Crunch] (yaps)
[Megan] Now hold still!
(She puts the piece of stone in Crunch's collar..)
[Buttons and Truly] Look..!
(..and he turns back to his old, stone form. However, he looks *much* happier.)
[Danny] I can't believe how happy he looks!
[Megan] Well, of course he does!
[Crunch] (yaps)
[Megan] (looks at the Heart Stone) Well, I guess we'd better get this back to His Eminence before he turns into a permanent 
        grump!

(And thus this episode's *other* insert song, "It's Wonderful To Have A Heart", begins. During this song, Megan, Danny, 
 the Ponies, Bushwoolies, and Crunch, make their way into the cave where the Heart Stone formerly resided. Throughout the 
 whole song, Crunch is acting like a 'normal' dog, and the other ponies are being friendly to Wind Whistler again. :3)

        ~ It's wonderful to have a heart
          It's wonderful when you can care
          It's wonderful when feelings start, and the feelings in your heart
          Are the kind you wanna share~!
      
          Discovering you have a heart
          Makes the gloom in your soul depart
          You smile about the sun
          For a new life has begun
          It's wonderful to have a heart~! ~

[Megan, Ponies, and the Bushwoolies] ~ Discovering you have a heart
                                       Makes the gloom in your soul depart ~

(Danny replaces the Heart Stone; His Elevated Eminence returns to his normal, cheery self.)

[Megan] ~ You smile about the sun
          For a new life has begun ~
[Megan, Ponies, and the Bushwoolies] ~ It's wonderful to have a heart~! ~

[His Elevated Eminence] Thank you for all your help! I'm pleased that Crunch now has a heart of his very own.
[Ponies and Megan] Goodbye! 
[Danny] Goodbye, Eminence!
[Ponies, Megan and Danny] Goodbye! Bye bye! (etc)

~~~

(The ponies, Bushwoolies and kids make their way back to Paradise Estate.)

[Buttons] Wind Whistler, er, we're sorry we said you had no feelings.
[Truly] And we, er, we wanna thank you for doing what you did back there.
[Wind Whistler] Why? Logic alone dictated my actions. It would have been too much trouble to carry three heavy stone statues all the way home.
(The others give Wind Whistler a look; she smiles.)
     Just kidding.

~ THE END! ~
