[Megan] Baby Heart Throb, please, sit down!

[Baby Heart Throb] Knight Shade, Knight Shade! Woooo!

[Knight Shade]  Do the moonwalk, ponies!

[Lickety-Split] I can't hear a thing! And I can't see, either!

[Megan]  Let me take care of this.
        Baby Heart Throb, please, sit down and be quiet!

[Lickety-Split]  Well, I guess that cooled her down!

[Lickety-Split]  I wasted a perfectly good ice cream cone on you.

[Baby Heart Throb] Ohhh.. lost ice cream cone.. Lemme get another one for Lickety-Split!

[Baby Half Note] We'll come, too!

[Megan] But I promised your mothers I'd bring you right back.

[Molly] Oh, come on, Megan. They'll only be gone a minute.

[Megan]  Well.. okay, but come right back.

[Baby Heart Throb] Promise!

[Zeb] C'mon, c'mon, hurry hurry hurry!
      Oh, my, my... what have we here?
      Ah, my fair young maidens, how do you do?

[Zeb] My name is Zeb, what might yours be?

[Baby Heart Throb]  Um, Baby Heart Throb.

[Baby Half Note] Baby Half Note!

[Baby Lofty] Baby Lofty!

[Baby Heart Throb] Gee, you workin'

[Zeb] Not really.. I'm Knight Shade's personal manager!

[Baby Ponies]  Knight Shade?!

[Zeb] My my, you must be fans..! How'd'you like to meet him?

[Baby Half Note] Would we?!

[Zeb] Then, come along, my lovelies, I'll take you to meet the great star himself.

[Knight Shade] It's a pleasure to meet all of you.

[Baby Half Note] Can we come back and sing tomorrow, Knight Shade?

[Knight Shade]  Oh, sorry. We're moving on right away.

[Baby Lofty] Aww, why you have to go?

[Knight Shade]  Oh, er, tomorrow we have to play in a village
               called, er, Rosedale!

[Zeb] Ah, er, Knight Shade, perhaps our new friends like a tour of the campgrounds
      before we move on? Ah, er, sorry I can't accompany you, but I've got some 'business'
      to attend to..

[Knight Shade]  Well, okay Zeb, we won't take long.

[Megan]  We're gonna have to go get 'em, Molly. The rest of you, wait for us here.

[Megan] Hi, we're looking for three baby Ponies, have you seen them?

[Zeb] Why, yes, I have; they were here just a little while ago, I sent them home to
      their mothers.

[Megan]  You did! Oh, good. Thanks for your help.

[Zeb] No problem ...no problem at all.

[Megan] They went back to Paradise Estate.

[Lickety-Split] What? Where's my ice cream cone?!

[Megan] Never mind, Lickety-Split. Come on, guys, let's go make sure the babies got home alright.

[Zeb] So, what do you think of our little set-up, eh?

[Baby Half Note] Nice, very nice!

[Zeb] Say, you three don't have any musical talents yourselves, do you?

[Baby Heart Throb] Oh, I do! Wanna be backup singer for Knight Shade!

[Zeb] No kidding.. You want to sing backup for Knight Shade.

[Knight Shade] Well, I'm very flattered.

[Baby Half Note] Baby Half Note sing better than Baby Heart Throb!

[Knight Shade] That was very nice!  But, wouldn't you be better
               off trying it together? Rather than as rivals?

[Knight Shade] See how much better you can do when you work together? So, you wanna join the tour, 
               huh?

[Zeb] Make up your minds quickly, we're getting ready to move on!

[Baby Ponies]  YES!!

[Molly] They're not here and they're not in the nursery.. Where can they be?

[Megan] I don't know, but here come Heart Throb and Lofty. We've got to tell them.

[Lofty] Tell us what?

[Megan] That.. the babies are gone.

[Heart Throb] The babies?!

[Lofty] Take it easy, Heart Throb.  You mean you lost them at the concert?

[Megan]  Let me explain while we go back to look for them.

[Heart Throb] Megan, what do you think has happened to our babies?

[Megan] Do you think they could have been kidnapped by Knight Shade?

[Lofty] That monster! I'm going to go after him right now! 

[Megan] No, Lofty. We'll have a better chance of finding them if we go back to 
        Paradise Estate and organize search parties.

[Megan] That's right, the Baby Ponies are missing, but we're going to find them.
        Lofty, why don't you lead the main search party? Okay, Whizzer, you can carry 
        messages.
        Now, Galaxy, you come with us. Fizzy, you go with the other group. 

[Knight Shade] That was great! Why don't you take a break?

[Baby Half Note] Woah..!

[Knight Shade] You alright, Baby Half Note?

[Baby Half Note] Feel kinda dizzy..

[Zeb] You've probably just had a little too much excitement for one day.

[Knight Shade] Oh, y-yeah, yeah, Zeb, that's right, uh, maybe you'd all better take a nap.

[Baby Heart Throb] Don't feel so good myself..

[Baby Lofty] Me either..

[Baby Heart Throb]  Look sick!

[Baby Half Note] All pale!

[Baby Lofty] Like ghosts!
             Feel sick.. too sick to fly.

[Baby Half Note] Baby Lofty, Baby Lofty, your shadow! Your shadow is gone!
                  All shadows gone!  Where's shadows?

[Camembert] Hello! I'm Camembert, the Mayor of Muensterville. How can I help you?

[Megan] Hello, Mr. Bert. We're looking for a musician called Knight Shade.

[Camembert]  Knight Shade, you say.. Knight Shade, Knight Shade..

[Megan] Well, have you seen him?

[Camembert] Possibly, possibly..

[Megan] Yes or no? We really need to know where he is.

[Camembert] Well, you're NOT going to find out!

[Heart Throb]  Oh, how will we ever find our babies now?!

[Knight Shade] What's wrong?

[Baby Lofty] You tricked us! Stole shadows! Not our friend! Made us sick! Now give 
             shadows back!

[Baby Half Note] Baby Lofty right!

[Baby Heart Throb] No, no.. Knight Shade no thief!

[Knight Shade] Ah, well, uh..

[Zeb]  Somebody stole your shadows, eh? That's some joke!

[Baby Lofty] No joke! Is true!

[Baby Half Note] You laugh, we go home.

[Roadie #1]  Where you goin', babies?

[Roadie #2]  You know, you shouldn't be out after dark, alone..

[Roadie #3]  Yeaaah. Somethin' baaad might happen to ya!

[Baby Heart Throb]  Never see other ponies again...

[Baby Lofty] Maybe they look for us right now?

[Lofty] Let us out of here!

[Heart Throb] We've got to find our babies!

[Megan] Save your breath. They won't let us go.

[Molly] But we didn't DO anything!

[Camembert] Didn't do anything? You've done plenty! Or rather, your friend Knight 
            Shade did. We don't know what's wrong, but we're not gonna let you do 
            that to the rest of us!

[Megan] But Knight Shade is not our friend!

[Camembert] So you say...

[Megan] Say.. I've got it! Mr. Mayor, look at the sick children. They cast no shadows!
        That's the reason they're sick. Knight Shade must have stolen their shadows!

[Galaxy] That makes sense. No doubt they feel empty and incomplete. The loss of their 
         shadows being an outward sign of some loss of substance.

[Lofty] Please, Mr. Mayor, you must let us go. What happened to your children could
        be happening to the Baby Ponies right now. We MUST be free to stop this 
        Knight Shade!

[Camembert] Well, perhaps I will let you go.

[Camembert] But, Sheriff Ricotta and I will go with you. You'll need our help to get 
            past our nasty cousins, the Roadies!

[Baby Heart Throb] Nobody comin' to save us..

[Baby Lofty] Where grown-ups?

[Baby Half Note] Can't give up! Hey.. let's sing!

[Megan] I wonder where the Baby Ponies could be?

[Heart Throb] Our babies!

[?] The coast is clear!

[Lofty] There!

[Megan] We're so glad we've found you. But you're so pale!

[Baby Heart Throb] We're sick..

[Baby Lofty] Knight Shade stole shadows..

[Megan] Well, he's not gonna get away with it. We're going to make him give those 
        shadows back!

[Molly]  There he is! Let's go after him!

[Megan] Where?

[Molly] He's on his way to his trailer.

[Lofty] Let's go get him!

[Megan] What IS that in the mirror?

[Heart Throb] It looks as if that looking-glass could use a good cleaning to me.

[Heart Throb] You fiend!

[Lofty] You'd better give our babies' back their shadows or else!

[Camembert] We're gonna make you pay for what you did to our children!

[Sheriff Ricotta] Yep!

[Ponies] Yeah!

[Megan] We've gotta catch Knight Shade!

[Lofty] Or we'll never get our babies' shadows!
        Look at that!

[Knight Shade] Oh- uh-  I- I didn't wanna do it! I
               didn't wanna do it!

[Megan] Then why did you?!

[Knight Shade] He MADE me do it!

[Megan] Who?

[Knight Shade] Erebus! He's a wizard. He looks like a big, gray storm cloud.

[Megan] That must be the thing we saw in the mirror!

[Knight Shade] Yes! That's how he gives me my orders!

[Megan] What kind of orders?

[Knight Shade] To steal shadows for him! Although Zeb is the one who actually steals 'em. 
               He puts them in his satchel.

[Megan] You mean, the babies' shadows are in the satchel he was carrying?

[Knight Shade] Yeah, that's right!

[Megan] And we let him get away... Was he taking them to Erebus?

[Knight Shade] Yeah! So you see, I couldn't give back your babies' shadows - I haven't got 'em!

[Lofty] What does Erebus do with the shadows?

[Knight Shade] I don't know exactly, but they give him power. Power which he uses to make me 
               do what he wants!

[Knight Shade]  You see, I come from Grayvale, a place that used to be called
               Bright Valley. I tried my best as a singer there, but nobody came to see me. 
               I was ready to give up, then Erebus came along. He said he was a wizard and 
               promised to make me a star! All he said he wanted in return.. was a little 
              co-operation. The first concert he promoted in Bright Valley was a smash! Everyone 
              in town was there!

[Knight Shade]  And while I was singing, Erebus had Zeb steal everyone's shadow -
               including my own mother's.
               When I saw what Erebus had done, I refused to work for him any more, and I 
               demanded that he give everyone their shadows back! But he threatened to steal 
               my shadow..

[Knight Shade]  ..and he laughed at me. I didn't know then that the shadows
               provided Erebus with energy that gave him his magical powers! And he used the 
               energy from the shadows to make himself into this huge cloud of energy! I don't 
               know how he does that - it's a closely guarded secret. I'm not even sure Zeb
               knows. Then Erebus made me take my act on the road, and he sent Zeb along to do 
               the shadow stealing! And as I became famous, more fans came to see me, Zeb stole 
               more shadows and Erebus became even more powerful! His hunger for power is endless! 
               And I'm forced to help Zeb supply him with more and more shadows. If I don't help him, 
               he'll steal my shadow, which would end my career. But worse, it would mean that I'd
               never have any hope of restoring Grayvale - and my mother - to the way they used to be.

[Baby Heart Throb] Pleaaase let him go, he didn't really wanna hurt us!

[Lofty] What do you think?

[Heart Throb] Poor creature didn't have any choice, did he?

[Knight Shade] Thank you, Baby Heart Throb. Y'know.. you're so lucky to have loved ones who 
               care about you so much. I have a wonderful mother - but she-  she has to
               live with the terrible shame of what I've done, to her AND Grayvale.

[Megan] I think we oughtta help Knight Shade.

[Molly] You mean we should fight Erebus ourselves?

[Megan] Exactly! That's the only way we'll ever get the babies' shadows back!

[Camembert] AND our children's shadows, too!

[Sheriff Ricotta]  Yup.

[Knight Shade] And my mothers, and the rest of Grayvale's!

[Megan] Well, what are we waiting for, guys? Knight Shade, show us the way to Grayvale!

[Ponies] Alright! Yeah! Yaaay!

[Megan] Where is everybody?

[Knight Shade] I think they must be in hiding.

[Grayvalian #1] Knight Shade...

[Grayvalian #2] Knight Shade...

[Grayvalian #3] Knight Shade!


[Megan, Molly, Ponies and Knight Shade]

[Grayvalian #4] You've got a lot of nerve coming back here, Knight Shade.

[Grayvalian #5]  And you'll be sorry you did...

[Megan] There's gotta be a way out! Keep looking!

[Heart Throb]  - I'm afraid we're doomed!

[Knight Shade's mother] Stop this! Please!
                         My son..

[Knight Shade] Mother, can you ever forgive me for what I've done?

[Knight Shade's mother] You're my son, I love you. Nothing could ever change that.

[Knight Shade's mother]  Please! Leave my son and his friends alone!

[Knight Shade] I didn't expect them to hate me so much.

[Knight Shade's mother] What else did you expect from them, my son? You haven't earned their 
                        trust. And Erebus possesses their spirit and courage.

[Knight Shade]  Not for long, he doesn't.

[Zeb] Yes, Master, Knight Shade has done well.
      I suggest we roll out the red carpet and give them all a welcome they'll never
      forget.

[Erebus] Capital idea, capital!

[Erebus]  Ah, my boy... You've done well. This is a fine assortment of shadows.
          Mmm, very fine indeed.

[Knight Shade] Surprise, Erebus! As of right now, I quit helping you steal shadows!

[Erebus]  You can't mean that! I make you what you are!

[Knight Shade] That's right, you did. But now I'm making my own decisions!
[Molly] That's right, not only is he quitting, but we want everyone's shadow back and 
        we want them back NOW.

[Erebus] I can't afford to let you turn on me, Knight Shade. You and your friends will pay dearly!

[Zeb] The master said you'd pay...
      ..and now, it's time for me to collect.

[Knight Shade] I'll take care of Zeb! Find that satchel!

[Megan] Okay, Knight Shade!

[Zeb] You fool, you're out of your league here! 

[Megan] The satchel should be in one of these rooms.

[Lickety-Split] We can't help running!

[Heart Throb] What'll we do?

[Camembert] The bushes, quick!

[Erebus] Hm? Ah, hahahaha! You can run, my little friends, but you can't hide!

[Camembert] Split up and hide!
[Lofty] It's our only chance!

[Megan] There's the satchel! 
        Got it! Now let's go find the others.

[Zeb] You girls oughtta watch where you're going!

[Megan] Come on, Molly, we've gotta stop him!

[Heart Throb] Oh, darlings! I'm so sorry! Are you both alright?

[Megan] We're fine. Have you seen Erebus?

[Heart Throb]  Seen him? Seen him? My darlings, we've been trying to stay
              away from him!

[Megan] Galaxy, use your light!

[Erebus]  No you won't!
         Zeb? Zeb, quickly! Bring the satchel!

[Camembert] Keep back!

[Galaxy] Mm..

[Erebus] I hunger, Zeb! Feed me!

[Zeb] My pleasure, master!

[Megan] Let's get Galaxy to safety.

[Megan] So the Shadow Satchel seems to be the source of Erebus' power!

[Molly] And the longer Erebus chased after us, and used up his energy, the smaller he 
        became!

[Megan] That's right! So we if we can keep him exerting himself long enough, we 
        should be able to beat him.

[Knight Shade] But we need an army for that.

[Megan] Well, that's kind of what I had in mind.

[Erebus]  Quickly, I need more! That one pony shadow wasn't enough!
         I need more and I need it now!

[Zeb] But master, there isn't any more. And without Knight Shade there's no way to lure people 
      to us!

[Erebus] I don't care, Zeb!
         I need more shadows, or I'll take yours!

[Zeb]  Yes, yes..

[Erebus] Now!

[Zeb] Oh, come on, I need your help.

[Megan]  Now remember..

[Molly] I know, I know, it's important..

[Megan] Now remember, Lofty. Stay low until you get out of Grayvale. We can't risk 
        Erebus spotting you.
         We're counting on you!

[Molly] Lofty, shouldn't we stay lower?

[Lofty] You're right, Molly.

[Molly]  Woah!

[Lofty] See, it's just so hard flying like this.

[Molly]  Lofty, help!

[Zeb] What a lovely little girl. Your shadow is just right for my collection!

[Lofty] NO!

[Zeb] While they're playing , I'll just take your shadow!

[Roadies] Woah..!

[Molly] Woah!
        That was close.

[Lofty] Hold on, we've got a long way to go.

[Knight Shade] Megan, there's no point in talking to the Grayvalians. They hate me!

[Megan] You're wrong, Knight Shade. We need them to get the Baby Ponies' shadows back! GRAYVALIANS! Together, 
        we can overcome Erebus and Zeb!

[Grayvalian #9] Why should we help you, when you stand with the very one who stole 
                our shadows?!

[Megan] Because our loved ones have lost their shadows, and we want to save them!

[Grayvalian #9] We trusted him before, and he betrayed our trust!

[Knight Shade] If you don't trust me, trust Megan and the Ponies! They-

[Grayvalian #9] No! Go! And leave us alone! There's nothing we can do.

[Erebus]  No shadows? You let them get away?
         I must have more shadows! Only Knight Shade can get me all the shadows I need!

[Zeb] I will not fail you again, Erebus!

[Megan] We've got to get the Shadow Satchel away from Zeb!

[Camembert] He and Erebus are gonna come looking for us,  because we're the only ones around with shadows! So when they come,
            we can be waiting for them!

[Megan] I'll stay here with Lickety-Split and Knight Shade and try to get them from behind, okay? 
        You and the sheriff can circle through the woods.

[Lickety-Split] We'd better do SOMETHING! They're here!

[Camembert]  Now's our chance!

[Erebus] There they are, Zeb!
         Return to me, Knight Shade, and I'll forgive you!

[Knight Shade] You can't fool me any more, Erebus! I'll never return! And I WON'T let you 
               hurt my friends!

[Zeb] Surrender, Knight Shade, you and your friends can't stop us!

[Erebus] You must return to me. Your friends cannot protect you!
          Now feed me! Give me that shadow now!

[Roadie #1] Going someplace?
            Zeb's waitin' for ya!

[Knight Shade] Leave this place, Erebus!

[Erebus] Listen to him, Zeb - he's giving me orders!

[Zeb] Such rudeness, and after everything you've done for him, too.

[Erebus] You should have stuck with me, my boy! I would have made you famous, and you could 
         have supplied me with shadows.

[Knight Shade's mother] Spare him!

[Erebus]  A mother's love! How touching!  Knight Shade, you don't want your
         mother to suffer, do you?

[Roadie #1] Hey, Boss, we got 'em! Aww, we got the big Cheesies, hurr hurr..

[Erebus] Seize them!

[Knight Shade's mother] Oh..!

[Knight Shade] Mother!

[Erebus] Knight Shade, you know I'm the only one that has really had the power to do anything for you! 
         Remember the fame? The adoring fans?

[Knight Shade]  It's not worth it any more, Erebus.

[Erebus] You're a real fool. Zeb! Another shadow. This time, get his friend, who thinks she's been 
         hiding from us in the bushes.

[Erebus] Knight Shade!

[Zeb] I'll just take your shadow.

[Knight Shade's mother] No!

[Zeb] Go away, don't bother me.

[Erebus]  YOU! Because of you and your friend, Knight Shade turned against me! Soon you'll join
         him in his torment!

[Megan] I have a surprise for you, Erebus.
        The Flutter Ponies! They're  to defeat you!

[Erebus] ZEB! Zeb! The satchel, use it!

[Zeb]  EREBUS! HELP ME!

[Megan] The shadows are returning!

[Heart Throb] They're getting their shadows!

[Baby Ponies]  Shadows!!

[Knight Shade's mother] To think that those pathetic creatures caused such problems.

[Grayvalian #10] But it'll never happen again. And we have Knight Shade to thank for that! Three 
                 cheers for Knight Shade!

[Ponies, Megan, Muensterville mice] Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!

[Knight Shade] I don't deserve your cheers. I just hope you'll forget what I did, and forgive me.

[Ponies and Megan]

[Baby Heart Throb] Knight Shade wonderfulest, bravest hero ever.
