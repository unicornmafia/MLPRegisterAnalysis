[Paradise]  "As Valentine watched her friend gallop away into the darkening sunset, a single lonely
                         tear rolled down her face.."

[Paradise] "..The End."

[Wind Whistler]  Why would Valentine's friend gallop away at sunset?

[Paradise]  ..huh?

[Wind Whistler] It is illogical to begin a long journey just as the sun is setting.

[Truly]  Who cares what the sun was doing when he had to leave his one true love?!

[Gusty]  Yeah, how can you ask a question like that at a time like this?

[Wind Whistler] Time like what?

[Wind Whistler] I fail to understand this display of sentiment! It is just a story,
                after all.

[Gusty] Wind Whistler, it's too bad you weren't around when the Feelings Fairy was passing out 
        feelings!

[Wind Whistler]  I do have feelings..

[Megan] Which I think you two just proved.

[Danny] Yeah, by hurting 'em.

[Gusty] Way to go, Buttons.

[Buttons] Moi?

[Blue Bushwoolie] LOOK OUT! Crunch the Rockdog comin'! Run for your lives!

[Bushwoolies] Yeah, run for your lives! Run! Yeah, run, run!

[Bushwoolies] Ow! I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry! It's okay! I'm glad you're sorry.

[Blue Bushwoolie] Let's go left!

[Bushwoolies] Right! Yeah, right left! Right left!

[Blue Bushwoolie] That's it, take it to the left!

[Bushwoolie #2] Right!

[Wind Whistler] I have feelings.. I merely refrain from expressing them at the drop of a hat.

[Megan] Don't feel bad, Wind Whistler.

[Danny] They didn't mean it.

[Purple Bushwoolie] HELP! HELP!!  The Rockdog from the Purple Mountain, oh, it was horrible!
                    Terrible, I tell ya! Turned to stone!  Made marshlands into rocky
                    valley!
                    Oh.. No more green, and.. and- and- and- and- and- Crunch the Rockdog turned Bushwoolies- 
                    turned Bushwoolies- to STONE!

[Gusty] I'm gonna give that obnoxious rock-whatsit a piece of my mind!

[Truly] I can't go nowhere 'til I change into my travelling outfit!

[Wind Whistler] Everyone! Please remain calm!

[Gusty] Calm? CALM?! Only someone with no feelings could remain calm at a time like this!

[Wind Whistler] I meant that we need a plan of action.

[Megan] She's right!

[Wind Whistler] But we better find out what makes this Rockdog tick!

[Megan] And for that, we'll have to talk to the Moochick.

[Danny]  Don't you worry, lil' fella. We won't let that
        walking stalagmite hurt you.

[Purple Bushwoolie]

[Megan] Hello? Mr. Moochick?

[The Moochick] Ooh- get it, ooh- ooh, no, no no no, ooh, no- no, that way-!

[Megan] What's going on here, Mr. Moochick?

[The Moochick] AFTER IT!

[Ponies] I'll get it! There it is!

[Wind Whistler] That is a.. a very smart stick.

[The Moochick] Huh! Too smart, if you ask me! Doesn't know its place!

[Danny] Aha!

[Truly] Oh, he's scared!

[Wind Whistler] Yes, he certainly is!

[Megan] Aww, the poor little thing.
        Perhaps it feels unappreciated, or overworked?

[The Moochick] Unappreciated? Overworked?!

[Truly] Let it have some fun!

[Buttons] Yeah, let it have a day off!

[Wind Whistler] Let's do that.

[The Moochick] Well, alright! It can have a day off every time the mushrooms bloom.
               Hah! Hm.. oh yes, yes, that is more like it.
               Now, what are you folks doing here?

[Megan] Have you heard of a Crunch the Rockdog? He comes from somewhere in the Purple Mountains.

[The Moochick] Oh, no no no, never heard of him. But! If he's from the Purple Mountains, then you should 
               talk to His Elevated Eminence, the Mountain King! Oh, just head for the Purple Mountains, 
               you can't miss it!

[Megan] Thank you, Mr. Moochick!

[The Moochick] At least, I think it's His Elevated Eminence.. or is it His Royal Rockface..? Hm..

[Danny] This is bad, alright.

[Purple Bushwoolie]  Purple Mountain!

[Megan] So that's where we'll find His Elevated Eminence, huh? 

[Gusty] What was that?

[Purple Bushwoolie] C-C-C-C-C-CRUNCH THE ROCKDOG!

[Purple Bushwoolie] Look out! Behind you!

[Danny] No, lil' fella! Don't do it!

[Purple Bushwoolie]  Behind you, behind you!!

[Pink Bushwoolie] Behind me? Behind me?!

[Crunch] Oh, look!  Two for the price of one!

[Purple Bushwoolie and Pink Bushwoolie]

[Crunch] One...
         Two.

[Ponies, Megan and Danny]

[Danny] I can handle him!

[Megan] Danny, don't!

[Danny] It's just a dog!

[Wind Whistler] Oh no!

[Danny] Hey, you!  Yeah, you! You fossilised mutt! You're a bad dog! BAD! Bad dog, sit! Sit!

[Danny] Heel, heel! You- you granite mongrel!

[Danny] Heel, boy! Lie down! Down!

[Truly] He's completely blown our cover!

[Wind Whistler] At this point, I fear our only recourse is to make a run for it.

[Megan] I think you're right.

[Danny] What's so funny?

[Megan]  C'mon, Danny!

[Crunch] Heel! Sit!  AFTER THEM!

[Gusty] Go on without me!

[Truly] Gusty! What in tarnation are you doin'?!

[Gusty] Go on! I've got an idea!

[Buttons] We're not leaving you!

[Gusty] I'll draw  them off, and catch up at the Mountains.

[Wind Whistler] Gusty, I must protest!

[Gusty] Here's gust in your eye!
        See? I blind 'em with a small dust storm, and I'm outta here!
        Uh-oh...
         Uh, come to think of it.. a little dust wouldn't have much
        effect on rocks, would it..?

[Crunch] Going somewhere?

[Crunch] Good! Cause I'd like you to... stick around!

[Megan, Danny, Wind Whistler and Buttons] GUSTY!

[Truly] That rock-thing's gonna be plum sorry he messed with our Gusty!

[Wind Whistler] She is beyond help. Logic clearly dictates that we save ourselves.

[Buttons] Gosh, Wind Whistler, how could you just go off and leave poor Gusty?

[Truly] What else would you expect from somebody with no feelings, Buttons?

[Megan] No, Truly, Wind Whistler's right, we've gotta go on without Gusty.

[Danny] Well, whatever we're gonna do, let's snap  it up!

[Truly] Bye-bye, Gusty! We'll be back!

[Megan] She knows, Truly. She knows.

[Danny] Woah..!

[Rocklings] TRACK THEM!

[Buttons] Y'know, Gusty was on the right track after all.
           This one's for you, Gusty!

[Truly] Buttons, don't!

[Buttons]  Betcha can't catch me!

[Rocklings] Oh YEAH?! Another one!

[Rocklings] Huh? Where'd she go?

[Buttons] Yoo-hoo! Over here!

[Rocklings] Hey, there she is!

[Wind Whistler] She's drawing them off. To the Mountains, then, quickly!

[Buttons]  No, this way!

[Truly] Oh, I hope Buttons is okay!

[Buttons] Oh, I'm sure she's fine.

[Truly]  Buttons! Y'all did it!

[Buttons] It doesn't take much to outsmart a rock.

[Danny] Okay. Now all we have to do is find this Eminence guy.

[Megan] The Moochick said if we go to the Purple Mountains, we couldn't miss him.

[His Elevated Eminence] Greetings!

[Megan] Uh.. Excuse me, whoever you are, but do you know where we can find His Elevated Eminence?

[His Elevated Eminence]  You're standing on him!

[Wind Whistler] Remarkable! This entire mountain is a living, sentient being!
                 Greetings, Your Elevated Eminence!

[Megan] Uh.. yes, greetings, Your Eminence. We've come to ask for your help. You see, Crunch the Rock-

[His Elevated Eminence] Oh, Crunch! He is definitely out of control. And it's all my fault! You see, I needed a guard to
      protect the Hot Stone, which is the magical gem that gives me feelings.
      I created Crunch the Rockdog to protect the gem, but I neglected to put any heart into Crunch himself, 
      accidentally creating a cold, ferocious beast! But I discovered my mistake too late. To make him 
      indestructible, I had put a piece of Black Lava Rock, from the roiling depths of the Volcano of Gloom,
      into his collar. It gives Crunch the power to turn anything to stone! 
      There's only one thing powerful enough to defeat him - the Heart Stone! You must take it and stop Crunch!

[Megan] Well, I.. guess that doesn't sound so difficult. Where is the Heart Stone, anyway?

[His Elevated Eminence] Deep within me.

[Buttons] And, how do we, er, get there?

[His Elevated Eminence] I'll guide you. But, er.. I'm not exactly certain what will happen when the Heart Stone is removed.

[Danny] W-what could possibly happen?

[Megan] Which way?

[His Elevated Eminence] To the left.

[Buttons] It's beautiful!

[Wind Whistler] Take it, Megan.

[Megan] Ooh.. Maybe I shouldn't.

[His Elevated Eminence] Go ahead, my dear.

[Danny] Which way, Your Eminence?

[Buttons] Uh-oh!

[Danny and Truly]

[Wind Whistler] Careful, Megan!

[His Elevated Eminence] GIVE ME MY HEART STONE!

[Megan] What's the matter with him?!

[Wind Whistler] If His Eminence gets his feelings from the Heart Stone..

[Danny] ..Then without it, he's turning into a major-league grouch!        RUN!

[Megan] Hurry!

[Buttons] This way.

[Truly] Hurry!

[Buttons] This way!

[Buttons and Truly?] Come on, let's go!

[Megan] Go! That way!

[Truly] Look!

[Crunch] I've found you! Who wants to be turned to stone first?

[Truly] You've gone too far this time, Rockdog.

[Megan] No, Truly!

[Danny] No, Truly, don't go!

[Buttons] Stay here!

[Wind Whistler] Go ahead.

[Crunch] Huh? "Go ahead?"

[Danny] What are you talking about?

[Buttons] What's the matter with you?

[Truly] You really don't like anyone, do you?

[Wind Whistler] I mean it! Go ahead! I don't care what you do with her.

[Crunch] You're crazy if you think I'll buy that.

[Wind Whistler] I'm perfectly serious. I've been surrounded by these romantic idiots for so long, it is refreshing to find 
     one such as yourself.

[Buttons] Wind Whistler! How could you?

[Wind Whistler] Pay no attention to them, Crunch!

[Crunch] You really don't care what I do to her?

[Wind Whistler] That sentimental fool? Certainly not.

[Crunch] Good, cause I'm gonna turn her to stone!
         Haha! I thought so! You DO care, don't you?

[Wind Whistler] Wait! I'll prove I'm on your side!
     By giving you your next victim!

[Megan]   Yeah, that's it, Wind Whistler, bring me to him!

[Crunch] The Heart Stone!

[Megan] Please, Heart Stone, do something!

[Crunch] NO!

[Buttons] It worked!

[Megan] She's alright!!

[Gusty] Hey you guys, look, it's me!

[Danny] Hooray, it's Gusty!

[Megan and Truly]

[Megan] I knew you wouldn't turn against us, Wind Whistler.

[Bushwoolies] Yeah, yeah! We're okay, we're okay! Yeah, yeah, fine! I feel good!

[Megan, Gusty, Buttons and Truly] Hooray! We found you!

[Megan, Gusty, Buttons and Truly]

[Crunch] Stop laughing! Stop cheering! Why are you so happy? There's nothing to be happy about! Stop it or I'll 
         bite ya!

[Megan] I bet all he needs is a little heart.

[Danny] Yeah, then he'd be a nice puppy!

[Megan] Now hold still!

[Buttons and Truly] Look..!

[Danny] I can't believe how happy he looks!

[Megan] Well, of course he does!

[Megan]  Well, I guess we'd better get this back to His Eminence before he turns into a permanent
        grump!

[Megan, Ponies, and the Bushwoolies]  Discovering you have a heart
                                       Makes the gloom in your soul depart ~


[Megan, Ponies, and the Bushwoolies]  It's wonderful to have a heart~! ~

[His Elevated Eminence] Thank you for all your help! I'm pleased that Crunch now has a heart of his very own.

[Ponies and Megan] Goodbye!

[Danny] Goodbye, Eminence!

[Ponies, Megan and Danny] Goodbye! Bye bye!

[Buttons] Wind Whistler, er, we're sorry we said you had no feelings.

[Truly] And we, er, we wanna thank you for doing what you did back there.

[Wind Whistler] Why? Logic alone dictated my actions. It would have been too much trouble to carry three heavy stone statues all the way home.  Just kidding.
