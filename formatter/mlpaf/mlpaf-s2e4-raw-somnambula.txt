(Note that many of the ponies listed above only appeared in the background, and did not have speaking parts in 
 this episode. I just listed them all cause I'm a completist like that :p)

** As with all of my transcripts, this is not intended to be a replacement for watching 
the episode itself, it's more for quoting purposes, easily checking lines without having to 
search through the episode for them, etc. **

Notes: 
- Okay, as far as I'm aware, this series did not have official 'seasons'. I chose to 
  list it as season two though, as it was from the second year of the series :).
- As with most episodes of MLP 'n Friends, this episode was shown in parts (two 
  parts, in this ep's case). So when I refer to parts, that's what I'm talking about :P.
- Accents! A looot of ponies in this ep have distinctive accents/voices. Truly has a 
  'southern belle' accent (mostly while she's speaking - when singing, she sounds a lot 
  like Bart Simpson :P Yes, they have the same voice actress), Tex has a stereotypical 
  'western' accent, etc. I tried to transcribe their accents as accurately as possible, so 
  if anything seems to be transcribed oddly, that's prolly why :B
- Near the end of the sequence for "The Big Brother Ponies", what looks like a Baby Paradise 
  is shown. Just for the record, no such pony was made. 
- I'm not sure that Kyrie's name *has* an official spelling. I've also seen it spelt as 'Kiri'. 
  Similarly, Hasbro never actually settled on a spelling for Baby Tiddley-Winks, it was spelt 
  several different ways over the years - so I went with the spelling shown on her backcard :).
- Expanding on what I said earlier.. the Big Brothers were given a lot of stereotypical lines 
  to match their 'theme' (i.e. Tex is a 'cow-pony', Steamer likes trains). Keep that in mind as 
  you read their lines, because quite a few of their lines sound.. odd when taken out of context >.>.
- Okay. Quarterback. For whatever reason, he was called "Score" in this ep; I'm guessing that was a 
  pre-production name for him or something. But either way, when writing this transcript I had a bit of 
  an internal struggle.. which name should I call him by here? Quarterback, his proper name and the name 
  I always think of him as? Or Score, which he's referred to throughout the episode? Eventually I went with 
  Quarterback, since I figured most people reading this would know what I meant. (Any lines calling him 'Score' 
  still say 'Score', of course. I'm just talking about what name to attribute his lines to, etc) I'm still 
  not 100% sure if that's confusing or not.. so feel free to email me with your thoughts on the matter, I'm 
  perfectly willing to switch things round :)

------------

(Truly, Paradise, Baby Half Note, Baby Ribbon, Baby Cuddles and Baby Tiddley-Winks rush 
 out of Paradise Estate, laughing.)

[Truly] We've gotta get these banners and bows and balloons and things up!
[Paradise] You're certainly on cloud nine today, Truly.
[Truly] But of course, Paradise! The Big Brother Ponies are comin' home!

(And so begins the episode's first insert song, "The Big Brother Ponies". During this 
 song, the ponies are, well, preparing for the Big Brothers to arrive. ^^; Mostly putting 
 up a finish line to signal the end of their race :).
 Note that for this song, 'all' means 'Truly, Paradise, Posey, Heart Throb and Lofty'.)

[Truly] ~ In a short time from now, the Big Brother Ponies,
          The Big Brother Ponies will arrive!
          Everyone will cheer, cause they've been away for a year~ ~

[Paradise and Posey] ~ They'll be making a bow
                       The Big Brother Ponies, the Big Brother Ponies look alive~ ~
[Truly] ~ They've been racin' 'round the world, but the finish is very near~ ~
[All] ~ This time tomorrow, the Big Brother Ponies will be here! ~

[Truly] ~ Bold and brave and strong
          They've been away so long ~
[Posey] ~ We have missed them very much, ~
[Truly and Paradise?] ~ but very soon we'll be in touch ~

[Truly and Paradise] ~ They've been racin' around the wo-orld
                       But the finish is ve-ery neaaar~ ~
[All] ~ This time tomorrow, the Big Brother Ponies, the Big Brother Ponies..
        Will be here! (yay!) ~

[Paradise] Gee, what if the Big Brothers don't make it on time?
[Posey] Who knows what might have happened to them? And a year's an awfully long time..
[Lofty] You're speaking of the Big Brothers! They'll be here alright! And they'll be on /time/.

(Buttons is hammering a nail with balloons attached to it onto the wall. She picks up the box 
 of nails with her mouth [remember, they're ponies..], but just then, Surprise rushes up behind
 her.)
[Surprise] (giggling) Surprise!!
(The box of nails flies out of Buttons' mouth, and the nails fly everywhere, popping all of the 
 balloons.)
           Hiya Buttons! Wasn't that a good surprise?
[Buttons] (annoyed/sarcastic) Uh, sure! Now help me replace all these 'surprise' balloons!
(Surprise reluctantly picks up the hammer, and Buttons holds one of the unpopped 
 balloons up to the wall. Carnival/circus-type music starts playing in the distance.)
          Do you hear something..? 
(Surprise and Buttons drop what they're holding, and stare off into the distance. 
 We pan out, and find out *where* this strange music is coming from; a stagecoach 
 hidden in the woods nearby. Standing by the stagecoach is a mysterious old woman 
 in a red cloak, the hood obscuring her face.)
[Somnambula] A bit louder, perhaps..
(She raises her arms up, and the music grows louder. Back at Paradise Estate, most of the 
 ponies are standing still and staring. Paradise, Posey and Buttons walk into view.)
[Paradise] It sounds like a circus!
(Cut back to the woods; the music stops playing. Somnambula reaches into her stagecoach, 
 and pulls out a cage with a bird in it.)
[Somnambula] Now, Kyrie, /sing/!
[Kyrie] (shaking her head) No, Somnambula, please, don't make me!
[Somnambula] SING!
(She points her hand at Kyrie; it glows, forcing Kyrie to sing against her will. Kyrie's song 
 is.. it's kind of hard to explain.. an 'aaahh...' kind of 'angelic' wailing. If that makes sense. 
 Back at Paradise Estate, the ponies slowly fall into trances, their pupils reducing to black dots.)
[Paradise] (speaking as if in a daze) Let's see what it is..
(She and the other ponies begin to trot off in search of the singing. Spike, who was previously 
 blowing balloons, rushes after them.) 
[Spike] Paradise! What are you doing?!
(He grabs onto her tail, trying to stop her, but she simply continues walking, dragging Spike along 
 on his stomach.)
        You- aaoh!
[Lofty] But the party! (falls into a trance) Oh well, it doesn't matter..
[Spike] No- Lofty! You can't! The party!
(Spike tries to hold Lofty back, but she simply pushes him out of the way.)
        Everybody! PLEASE don't do this! 

(Meanwhile, while this is all going on, Truly and several of the baby ponies are 
 gathered behind Paradise Estate, practicing playing marching band-type music. Truly 
 is wearing the Pony Wear outfit "Strike Up The Band". Truly stops playing, annoyed.)

[Truly] We're gonna play this when the Big Brothers cross the finish line, so get it right!
[Baby Lofty] You hear somethin'? 
[Truly] I surely do - I hear the sound of y'all not playin'!

(She starts playing again, drowning out Kyrie's singing. The other ponies, meanwhile, 
 have found Somnambula, and are gathered around her.)
[Somnambula] That's enough, Kyrie. 
(She puts Kyrie back in the stagecoach. Somnambula raises her hands to her hood, and as she 
 does so, her hands change; previously gnarled, old and worn, they are now completely gnarl-free :D 
 She pulls down her hood, revealing herself to be, well, an old woman.) 
             Ah, I feel..
(Somnambula regains her youth, turning into a 20-something young lady with long, curly black hair. 
 Her voice changes accordingly.)
             ..better already. (to the ponies) Welcome. 
[Paradise] (unsure) We thought we heard.. a circus. 
[Somnambula] And so you did.
(Somnambula turns around, and uses her magic to create an amusement park in the distance.)
             We can go there if you like~
(She sits down on the front of the stagecoach and raises a whip, ready to strike the ox harnessed 
 to the coach.)
             All you have to do is follow me~
(She strikes the ox, and it begins pulling the coach - and, so it goes, Somnambula - in the direction 
 of the amusement park; the ponies follow her, and the screen begins to fade out, though it doesn't fade 
 out entirely - if that makes sense.)
 
~~~

(The Big Brother Ponies are running through Dream Valley, towards Paradise Estate, laughing.)

[Quarterback] Fourth down and five yards to go, Steamer! We're almost /home/!
[Steamer] Yeah, and I'm gonna ride all over your rails at the finish line, Score!
[4-Speed] Ah, just think, Salty! In a few moments, we'll see Paradise Estate again! Ah, after all 
          this time..
[Salty] (laughs) Aye, matey! We'll hoist our jim and lay ha-hard into port!
[4-Speed] (confused) Uh... right.
[Tex] Reckon you're lookin' forward to seein' them (laughs) lil' fillies when we get home, eh Slugger?
[Slugger] (dazed/distractedly) Yep.
[Tex] Especially that there Buttons, huh?
[Slugger] (still dazed) Yep..
[Tex] Hm.. sure hope she can improve your talkin' abilities some!
(Paradise Estate comes into view.)
      Yee-haw! Gonna bust your chops, Score!
[Quarterback] It ain't a touchdown 'til you pass the goalpost, Tex!
(The Big Brothers run through the finish line, their journey over at last. They notice the odd 
 lack of Little Ponies waiting to greet them.)
[Salty] Ho-ho-ho, blow me down!
[Slugger] Where IS everybody?
[Tex] Maybe they forgot we was comin'?
[4-Speed] Ah, not the Little Ponies!
[Slugger] N-not /Buttons/!
[Steamer] They'd never forget!
[Quarterback] (stamps down hoof) I've got it! This is all a /gag/! All we gotta do is walk through 
              that door, and they'll all jump out yelling "surprise!".
(They walk through Paradise Estate, looking around for the Little Ponies.)
[Tex] It's the Big Brothers y'all! 
[4-Speed] Ah, you can jump out and surprise us now~
[Quarterback] Anybody home?
[Salty] (hopefully) Ahoy?
[Quarterback] (turns to the other Big Brothers) There is something seriously wrong here.

(They continue looking through Paradise Estate, but to no avail. Eventually, they end up at the back 
 of the Estate.)
              Who could imagine we'd return after all this time to find Paradise Estate abandoned? 
              Devoid of life? Silent!
(Suddenly, Truly calls out to them from off-screen. The Big Brothers fall over in surprise.)
[Truly] You're here!
(Truly, Spike and the baby ponies walk up to the Big Brothers.)
[Baby Cuddles] You're here!
[Spike] Hooray!
[Baby Cuddles] Me hap-py!
[Quarterback] What happened to everybody?
[Spike] They heard the sound of a circus!
[Truly] And they all just up and left!
[Spike] Like they were in some kind of trance or something! I heard it, but it didn't bother me.
[Baby Lofty] Me heard it too, but no make me go.
[Quarterback] Hm. It sounds like it affects JUST the Little Ponies, and /not/ the babies!
[Spike] And not baby dragons!
[4-Speed] What d'you think we should do?
[Quarterback] I think Truly and the others should wait here! (canters away) While we go find 'em!
(The Big Brothers run off to start their search.)
[Baby Heart Throb] They're just so dashing.
[Spike] And brave.
[Truly] Oh, I do hope they can rescue the others..

(fade to next scene)

~~~

(At the amusement park, Somnambula is putting a manacle around a pony's hoof, laughing maniacally.)
[Somnambula] Ah.. I can feel my powers increasing already!
(We see the other ponies walking through the amusement park, which is simply an illusion.)
             Now I can make all this /real/!
(Cupcake walks through an illusion of a kitchen, and gasps when it becomes real due to 
 Somnambula's magic. Someone begins talking, though it's not really clear *who*. The kitchen? Whoever 
 it is, they have a kind of 'ringleader' voice.)
[Ringleader] Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, here it is! The wonder kitchen, bake to your heart's content!
(Posey walks by a garden, her eyes widening as that, too, becomes real. She runs through the garden, 
 delighted.)
             Step right up, folks! The gardener's delight! 
(Posey sees various 'bins' full of flower/plant seeds, all with small shovels in the bins.)
[Posey] Oh boy, seeds!
(She picks up a shovel and happily runs around, spreading the seeds everywhere. Cut to Lickety-Split, 
 who is walking around entranced.)
[Ringleader] Ice cream, ladies and gents! All you can eat!
(Lickety-Split shakes her head, snapping out of it, and rushes over to the nearby ice cream parlour, 
 overjoyed.)
[Lickety-Split] I'll have one of each!

~~~ 

(Meanwhile, the Big Brothers are still searching - and it's getting late.)
[Steamer] We've been following the Ponies' tracks all day without a sign of 'em!
[Quarterback] And it's getting dark! We're gonna have to bed down soon.
[Slugger] N-no! We keep searching!
[Tex] No way, Slugger! Why, in five minutes, you won't be able to see your own nose!
(The sun sets, and it is indeed as dark as Tex predicted. The Little Ponies are still 
 happily playing in Somnambula's amusement park, oblivious. Underneath the park, Somnambula still has 
 Kyrie captured.)
[Somnambula] Now, Kyrie - sing for me!
[Kyrie] No, Somnambula! It's not right!
[Somnambula] /I/ have the power to make my illusions /real/ now!
(Her hands glow, and she zaps Kyrie's cage.)
[Kyrie] Uh- ah- alright, alright!
(Kyrie grows larger than normal due to Somnambula's magic, and once again begins singing, louder than 
 before. Back at Paradise Estate, Truly, Spike and the baby ponies are sleeping. Kyrie's song makes Truly 
 wake up, though, and she wanders out of Paradise Estate in a trance - which makes Spike wake up.)
[Spike] TRULY! 
(The baby ponies wake up)
        Come on! We've gotta stop her!
(They rush after Truly, grabbing onto her tail to try and stop her..)
        Hurry! Oh, Truly, wake up! 
(..but it's no use. Truly gets away and rushes off to try and find Somnambula. Spike and the babies run
 after her, past the Big Brothers, who are curled up asleep okay. Kyrie's song wakes them up, too, and they 
 also walk off in a trance.)
        Oh no!
[Baby Heart Throb] Not Big Brothers too!
[Spike] We gotta break their trance somehow!

(Truly and the Big Brothers run by a cliff covered in half-melted snow; Spike and the babies gather it all up 
 into a huge snowball, and roll it up to the cliff edge.)
        Oh, I hate to do this, but.. LET 'EM HAVE IT!
(They roll the snowball off the cliff, and onto the Big Brothers; it rouses them immediately.)
[Tex] (annoyed) What in the sam hill..? (stands up)
[Quarterback] What're we doin' here?
[Steamer] Somebody knocked us off the tracks!
(The baby ponies and Spike walk up to them.)
[Spike] It was us!
[Tex] What's that singin'?
[Baby Heart Throb] It's funny singing!
[Baby Lofty] It makes all the grown-up ponies act strange! Even Big Brothers, like they walkin' in sleep!
[Steamer] Where's it coming from?
[Quarterback] (turns around and points) Right there!
(We see Truly walking towards the entrance of the amusement park; a pair of tall, golden doors. Slugger walks 
 after her, still under Somnambula's spell. The Big Brothers rush after them.)
[Steamer] Slugger! What're you doing?!
(Truly walks right through the doors, which are simply an illusion.)
[Tex] Truly!
[Baby Ponies] Ah! Oh, (no/don't?)!
[Spike] Come back!!
(They catch up to Slugger, who has seemingly snapped out of the trance.)
[4-Speed] Ah, you okay good buddy?
[Slugger] Yep, I-I think so..
[Quarterback] (points to the door) THAT'S where we've gotta go!

(As they walk towards the door, Somnambula's magic changes it to a door in the shape of a crocodile's jaws.. We 
 fade to black. End of part one.)

~~~

(Beginning of part two.)

(The Big Brother Ponies are still gathered in front of the door, which is locked and bolted.)

[Tex] Looks a mite dangerous, Score.
[Quarterback] That's where the Little Ponies are, Tex. 
[Slugger] That's where /Buttons/ is!
[Quarterback] Then /that's/ where we're gonna go!
[Tex] (to the baby ponies) Now, you lil' 'uns head back up to the hills and stay safe!
(The baby ponies and Spike nod, and retreat. Quarterback rears onto his back legs and jumps onto the giant lock.)
[Quarterback] (to the Big Brothers) Come on, let's see some teamwork!
(Salty stands in front of the door; Slugger jumps onto his back, and Tex jumps onto Slugger's back, forming a 
 kind of 'pony pyramid' ^_~ Tex slowly pulls back the lock with his mouth, and Quarterback pulls the latch down, 
 opening the door; he then falls down, landing on top of the other Big Brothers ^_~.)
              Now that's what I call teamwork!
(They look through the door at the amusement park.)
[Tex] (amazed) Boy howdy..

(The Big Brother Ponies look around Somnambula's amusement park, searching for the Little Ponies.)
[4-Speed] I'm beginnin' to understand why all the Little Ponies left home!
[Quarterback] Maybe. But there's something weird about all this.
(Suddenly, they see Truly, standing in front of a mansion. She looks a little.. odd.)
              Truly! Hey, c'mere, we wanna talk to ya!
(Truly picks up a teapot from a little stand in front of the mansion, then takes it inside the mansion, completely 
 ignoring Quarterback. He turns back to the other Big Brothers.)
              Well how d'you like that?
(Lickety-Split rushes past them.)
[Salty] (surprised) Lickety-Split?
[Tex] It's us! It's the Big Brother Ponies!
(Lickety continues to run towards the ice cream parlour)
[Lickety-Split] Not now, I've gotta get some more ice cream!
(The Big Brothers exchange looks, then walk on.)

(Heart Throb is dancing on a stage, a veil covering her muzzle. There's kind of 'Arabian' music playing in this scene 
 [dunno how to describe it - think harem dancers]. Note that for whatever reason, Heart Throb is drawn as an Earth pony 
 in this scene, instead of a Pegasus :p) 
[Quarterback] Heart Throb!
[Heart Throb] No! I am Salome, one of the most famous lovers in history!
[4-Speed] Heart Throb, don't you recognize us?
[Heart Throb] Go away, you're spoiling my performance!
[Quarterback] No! You're gonna listen to us!
(He grabs Heart Throb's veil and pulls it away, revealing that Heart Throb's face is old and wrinkled. He drops the veil 
 in surprise.) 
              Heart Throb.. you're so /old/!
[Heart Throb] I feel fine! Now get out of here! (imitating Greta Garbo) I vant to be alone.

~~~

(The Big Brothers continue their search, and stop when they find Gingerbread, standing by - appropriately enough - 
 a giant gingerbread house.)
[Quarterback] (happily) Gingerbread!
(She turns to face them, revealing that she, too, has aged. The Big Brothers gasp. Fade out to the next scene.)

~~~

[Slugger] I just gotta find Buttons - I gotta know if she's okay!
[Tex] That gal's face looked like 40 miles of bad road!
[Salty] Something is not altogether ship-shape here!
[Quarterback] I'll say! We've got to get them out of here now. And we can't let anything stop us!

(Just as he says that, the ground begins shaking.)
[Big Brothers] Woah!
(The ground cracks open, and things begin appearing out of nowhere - first, a small, pony-sized monster truck appears.)
[4-Speed] (impressed) Well shift my gears!
(Two baseball bats and catcher's mitts appear; Slugger looks surprised. A farmhouse and rodeo ring [if that's the right name 
 for it..] appear, complete with several bulls.)
[Tex] Woah, what a spread!
(A train and train tracks appear; they gasp again, as a little steamboat also appears.) 
[Salty] Ho-ho-ho, blow me down!
(Finally, an American football pitch appear.)
[Quarterback] Now who could've known that football is my game?
[Salty] Aye, and there's the fine ship /I've/ always wanted!
[Quarterback] Wait a minute, guys! This isn't right! It's /too/ perfect!
[Steamer] (dreamily) Yeah, ain't it just?

(This episode's other insert song, "Hey, Let's Play/No, Let's Go" - sung by the Big Brother Ponies.. :D This song plays as 
 half of the Big Brothers attempt to play with the aforementioned objects made by Somnambula - while Slugger and Quarterback 
 try to bring them back to their senses :p)

[Steamer] ~ Hey, let's play!
            I really enjoy fooling around with my brand new toy! ~

[Quarterback and Slugger] ~ No, let's go!
                            There's work to be done, and after we're through, 
                            we'll have time for fun! ~

[Salty and 4-Speed] ~ Hey, let's /play/!
                      I'm feeling the itch
                      Horsing around would be quite a switch! ~

[Quarterback and Slugger] ~ No, let's go!
                            There's trouble ahead! Let's keep alert!
                            Or we'll be misled! ~

[Tex] ~ Couldn't we play for just a minute, 
        then be on our way~? ~

[Quarterback and Slugger] ~ No, no, don't go astray
                            No, no, we mustn't stay
                            If we do, we'll rue the day~!

                            We'll play later! ~
[Tex] (reluctantly) ~ Okay.. ~
[Quarterback and Slugger] ~ We'll play later! ~
[4-Speed, Salty and Steamer] ~ Okay! ~
[Quarterback and Slugger] ~ We'll play later! ~
[4-Speed, Salty, Steamer and Tex] ~ Okay, okay~! ~

(Cut to Somnambula, looking into a crystal ball.)
[Somnambula] So, they won't play, eh?
(She walks over to Kyrie.)
[Kyrie] No! No, don't make me do it Somnambula! What you're doing is /evil/!
[Somnambula] I have my youth back - I have my new powers! YOU don't think I'm going to stop now, do you?!
(She enchants Kyrie again, forcing her to sing once more.) 
             Now, /sing/!
(Kyrie sings; the Big Brothers fall under her spell and wander off vaguely.)
[Quarterback] No! Don't listen to it..!
(Steamer climbs into the train.)
[Steamer] All aboard!
(Tex leaps into the rodeo ring.)
[Tex] Yee-haw, it's round-up time!
(4-Speed climbs into the truck.)
[4-Speed] Let's burn rubber!
(Salty jumps into the steamboat..)
[Salty] All power back, full speed ahead!
(Slugger picks up a baseball bat with his mouth, and begins playing an imaginary game of baseball.)
[Slugger] Batter up!
(Quarterback rushes over to the American football pitch, picks up an American football [he.. sort of rests it under his 
 chin, it's hard to describe, it's kind of oddly animated, lol] and begins.. playing American football. X) Explaining sports 
 is not my forte, sorry!)
[Quarterback] It's a (wide-in?) run! He's on the 50, the 40, the 30!
(Somnambula laughs evilly, watching her work unfold through her crystal ball. She walks over to a small door hidden in the 
 wall and goes through it, leaving Kyrie alone.)
[Kyrie] I've got to get out of here! I've just /got/ to! 
(She pushes against the bars of her cage, until it tips off the rock its sitting on onto the floor, and breaks open. However, 
 as Kyrie's eyes are closed, she doesn't notice this immediately.)
        Gotta get out! Gotta get out! Go- (she realizes, and gasps) I am out! 
(Kyrie flies away, through a little window. Outside the amusement park, the baby ponies and Spike are still waiting. Please 
 note that 'baby ponies', for this scene at least, refers to Babies Heart Throb, Lofty and Cuddles.)
[Baby Heart Throb] (points to the sky) Hey, look!
(They see Kyrie flying away.)
[Baby Lofty?] Hey!
[Spike] Over here!
[Baby ponies] There she is, here, here! (etc)
(Kyrie flies over to them.)
[Kyrie] What d'you want?
[Spike] Have you seen the ponies?
[Kyrie] They're in there, and they're all playing!
(beat)
[Baby Heart Throb] What?
[Kyrie] Somnambula made me sing them into a trance.
[Baby Lofty] Who's So'nambula?
[Kyrie] (fiercely) She's an awful witch, who takes youth for herself and only gives back age.
[Spike] Y-you put them in a trance?!
[Baby Lofty] Can you put them out of it?
[Kyrie] Well, I suppose I /could/ sing a different song, but I'm not going back there! I'm not going anywhere /near/ Somnambula 
        again!
[Spike] But you have to help us!
[Baby Cuddles] /Please/!
[Baby Lofty] Help rescue our friends!
[Baby Cuddles, Baby Lofty and Spike] Help us! Please! (etc)
[Kyrie] (giving in) Okay.. I'll help. Will you come with me?
[Baby ponies and Spike] YES!

~~~

(The baby ponies, Spike and Kyrie walk through the amusement park, as Gingerbread wanders around kind of frantically.)

[Spike] Okay, no one's around!
[Kyrie] Cover your ears!
(They cover their ears, and Kyrie sings again, but this time it's different - more screechy and wailing. It attracts the 
 attention of Gingerbread and Quarterback.)
[Quarterback] The Ponies! (rushes off) Got to help them!
(We see Lickety-Split, eating an ice cream sundae. It falls on her head as she turns around, curious.)
[4-Speed] (still driving the truck) What am I /doin'/?!

~~~

(The Big Brother ponies, Lickety-Split, Truly, Gingerbread and Heart Throb stand in front of the babies, Kyrie and Spike, out of the 
 trance - but the Little Ponies are still old.)

[Truly] You came, you rescued us!
[Heart Throb] Our heroes!
[Gingerbread] But what's happened to us? We're so old..
(Slugger runs up to the others.)
[Slugger] Where's Buttons? I can't find her!
[4-Speed] Yeah, I haven't seen ANY of the unicorns!

(A trap door appears in the ground, and with a burst of smoke and fog and such, Somnambula appears.)
[Somnambula] And you won't, either!
(The ponies back away; she advances. Suddenly, 4-Speed's truck, Gingerbread's gingerbread house and Truly's mansion begin to move 
 forward, towards the Ponies.. yeah, I know how weird this sounds :P The mansion.. this is hard to explain.. there are vines growing 
 up and down the walls, and in this scene, the vines fly out and start waving around, I guess, trying to catch the ponies.)
[Quarterback] 4-Speed, Slugger, come with me! The rest of you - protect the Little Ponies! 
              (to 4-Speed and Slugger) And bring that bird!

(Quarterback, 4-Speed, Slugger and Kyrie rush off down the trap door. Somnambula stares, shocked, and runs after them.)
[Tex] (to Salty and Steamer) You heard 'im! Let's get down to business!
      (they run forward) YEE-HAW!

(In Somnambula's lair, beneath the amusement park, there's a metal door blocking the way.)
[Quarterback] Let's break it down!
(He, Slugger and 4-Speed launch themselves at the door, but, of course, fall down.)
              ..Let's try again.

(Back at the amusement park, the gingerbread house is chasing after Gingerbread. No, really.)
[Gingerbread house] Now /you'll/ know what it's like to have someone gnawin' on /you/!
(The truck is chasing after Steamer; he runs past Gingerbread and the truck crashes into the gingerbread house, breaking it into 
 pieces.)
[Gingerbread house] Hey, watch where you're goin'!

(Below the 'park, Quarterback and the others are still trying, and failing, to break the door down.)
[4-Speed] This is gettin' us nowhere!
[Quarterback] We've got to get it open! Remember Slugger - Buttons is probably on the other side!
(Slugger gets up and runs at the door determinedly. He kicks it with his back legs and it falls down, clearing the way for them. 
 He and the others walk through to the other room.)
[4-Speed] It's like all their magic powers are being sucked into that crystal!
(Pan over to said crystal; Galaxy, Gusty, Buttons and Ribbon are chained round it, their horns glowing. Kyrie lands on top of the 
 crystal.)
[Kyrie] So.. that's it! Somnambula's been getting her youth from the other ponies, and her new powers from the unicorns!
[Somnambula] Quite right, Kyrie!
(A cage appears around Kyrie, trapping her.)
             And I've no intention of giving them up!

(Above, the ponies are still being chased around. Tex is being chased by the train.)
[Tex] Woohoo!
(The train gets tangled up in the mansion's vines; it crashes. Cut back to Somnambula's lair.)

[Quarterback] Sing, Kyrie - wake the unicorns up!
[Somnambula] But - she can't~!
(She points to Kyrie, who is now wearing a muzzle.)
[Kyrie] (muffled squeaks)
[Slugger] T-then, I'll stop you myself! (gets ready to charge)
[Somnambula] Ah - but you won't.
(She waves her finger, and Slugger, 4-Speed and Quarterback become chained to the wall. Somnambula laughs evilly.
 They all struggle, of course, but Slugger struggles the hardest..)
[Slugger] Buttons! 
(He pulls a chunk out of the wall and rushes forward, freed.)
[Somnambula] (gasps) NO!
(Slugger knocks the crystal off its pedestal.. thing)
             NO!!
(The crystal falls to the ground, and breaks. Somnambula turns back into an old woman.)
             No..!
(Her illusions disappear - Kyrie and the Big Brothers are free. They rush forward. Above the ground, the amusement park 
 disappears, leaving only Somnambula's stagecoach. She rushes up to it, covering her face, and jumps onto it, driving away 
 as fast as possible.)
             No, no!!
(The Little Ponies regain their youth~)
[Tex] Well, tie me up and brand me! Y'all's young again!
[Quarterback] And everybody's safe and sound.
[Steamer] What about Slugger?
[Gingerbread] And Buttons?
[Quarterback] Don't worry! They're the safest and soundest of any of us!
(Cut to the trap door - Slugger and Buttons climb out of it together. Buttons nuzzles Slugger. The baby ponies giggle, 
 and Slugger and Buttons walk over to the others together, as Buttons giggles. The ponies, Spike and Kyrie leave the remains 
 of the amusement park.)
[Salty] Let's hard a-port (?) and set sail for safe dry-dock!
[Tex] I've got a better idea, Salty - let's go home instead?

~ THE END! ~
