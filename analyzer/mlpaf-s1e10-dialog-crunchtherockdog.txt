"As Valentine watched her friend gallop away into the darkening sunset, a single lonely  tear rolled down her face.."
"..The End."
Why would Valentine's friend gallop away at sunset?
..huh?
It is illogical to begin a long journey just as the sun is setting.
Who cares what the sun was doing when he had to leave his one true love?!
Yeah, how can you ask a question like that at a time like this?
Time like what?
I fail to understand this display of sentiment! It is just a story,  after all.
Wind Whistler, it's too bad you weren't around when the Feelings Fairy was passing out  feelings!
I do have feelings..
Which I think you two just proved.
Yeah, by hurting 'em.
Way to go, Buttons.
Moi?
LOOK OUT! Crunch the Rockdog comin'! Run for your lives!
Yeah, run for your lives! Run! Yeah, run, run!
Ow! I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry! It's okay! I'm glad you're sorry.
Let's go left!
Right! Yeah, right left! Right left!
That's it, take it to the left!
Right!
I have feelings.. I merely refrain from expressing them at the drop of a hat.
Don't feel bad, Wind Whistler.
They didn't mean it.
HELP! HELP!!  The Rockdog from the Purple Mountain, oh, it was horrible!  Terrible, I tell ya! Turned to stone!  Made marshlands into rocky  valley!  Oh.. No more green, and.. and- and- and- and- and- Crunch the Rockdog turned Bushwoolies-  turned Bushwoolies- to STONE!
I'm gonna give that obnoxious rock-whatsit a piece of my mind!
I can't go nowhere 'til I change into my travelling outfit!
Everyone! Please remain calm!
Calm? CALM?! Only someone with no feelings could remain calm at a time like this!
I meant that we need a plan of action.
She's right!
But we better find out what makes this Rockdog tick!
And for that, we'll have to talk to the Moochick.
Don't you worry, lil' fella. We won't let that  walking stalagmite hurt you.
Hello? Mr. Moochick?
Ooh- get it, ooh- ooh, no, no no no, ooh, no- no, that way-!
What's going on here, Mr. Moochick?
AFTER IT!
I'll get it! There it is!
That is a.. a very smart stick.
Huh! Too smart, if you ask me! Doesn't know its place!
Aha!
Oh, he's scared!
Yes, he certainly is!
Aww, the poor little thing.  Perhaps it feels unappreciated, or overworked?
Unappreciated? Overworked?!
Let it have some fun!
Yeah, let it have a day off!
Let's do that.
Well, alright! It can have a day off every time the mushrooms bloom.  Hah! Hm.. oh yes, yes, that is more like it.  Now, what are you folks doing here?
Have you heard of a Crunch the Rockdog? He comes from somewhere in the Purple Mountains.
Oh, no no no, never heard of him. But! If he's from the Purple Mountains, then you should  talk to His Elevated Eminence, the Mountain King! Oh, just head for the Purple Mountains,  you can't miss it!
Thank you, Mr. Moochick!
At least, I think it's His Elevated Eminence.. or is it His Royal Rockface..? Hm..
This is bad, alright.
Purple Mountain!
So that's where we'll find His Elevated Eminence, huh?
What was that?
C-C-C-C-C-CRUNCH THE ROCKDOG!
Look out! Behind you!
No, lil' fella! Don't do it!
Behind you, behind you!!
Behind me? Behind me?!
Oh, look!  Two for the price of one!
One...  Two.
I can handle him!
Danny, don't!
It's just a dog!
Oh no!
Hey, you!  Yeah, you! You fossilised mutt! You're a bad dog! BAD! Bad dog, sit! Sit!
Heel, heel! You- you granite mongrel!
Heel, boy! Lie down! Down!
He's completely blown our cover!
At this point, I fear our only recourse is to make a run for it.
I think you're right.
What's so funny?
C'mon, Danny!
Heel! Sit!  AFTER THEM!
Go on without me!
Gusty! What in tarnation are you doin'?!
Go on! I've got an idea!
We're not leaving you!
I'll draw  them off, and catch up at the Mountains.
Gusty, I must protest!
Here's gust in your eye!  See? I blind 'em with a small dust storm, and I'm outta here!  Uh-oh...  Uh, come to think of it.. a little dust wouldn't have much  effect on rocks, would it..?
Going somewhere?
Good! Cause I'd like you to... stick around!
GUSTY!
That rock-thing's gonna be plum sorry he messed with our Gusty!
She is beyond help. Logic clearly dictates that we save ourselves.
Gosh, Wind Whistler, how could you just go off and leave poor Gusty?
What else would you expect from somebody with no feelings, Buttons?
No, Truly, Wind Whistler's right, we've gotta go on without Gusty.
Well, whatever we're gonna do, let's snap  it up!
Bye-bye, Gusty! We'll be back!
She knows, Truly. She knows.
Woah..!
TRACK THEM!
Y'know, Gusty was on the right track after all.  This one's for you, Gusty!
Buttons, don't!
Betcha can't catch me!
Oh YEAH?! Another one!
Huh? Where'd she go?
Yoo-hoo! Over here!
Hey, there she is!
She's drawing them off. To the Mountains, then, quickly!
No, this way!
Oh, I hope Buttons is okay!
Oh, I'm sure she's fine.
Buttons! Y'all did it!
It doesn't take much to outsmart a rock.
Okay. Now all we have to do is find this Eminence guy.
The Moochick said if we go to the Purple Mountains, we couldn't miss him.
Greetings!
Uh.. Excuse me, whoever you are, but do you know where we can find His Elevated Eminence?
You're standing on him!
Remarkable! This entire mountain is a living, sentient being!  Greetings, Your Elevated Eminence!
Uh.. yes, greetings, Your Eminence. We've come to ask for your help. You see, Crunch the Rock-
Oh, Crunch! He is definitely out of control. And it's all my fault! You see, I needed a guard to  protect the Hot Stone, which is the magical gem that gives me feelings.  I created Crunch the Rockdog to protect the gem, but I neglected to put any heart into Crunch himself,  accidentally creating a cold, ferocious beast! But I discovered my mistake too late. To make him  indestructible, I had put a piece of Black Lava Rock, from the roiling depths of the Volcano of Gloom,  into his collar. It gives Crunch the power to turn anything to stone!  There's only one thing powerful enough to defeat him - the Heart Stone! You must take it and stop Crunch!
Well, I.. guess that doesn't sound so difficult. Where is the Heart Stone, anyway?
Deep within me.
And, how do we, er, get there?
I'll guide you. But, er.. I'm not exactly certain what will happen when the Heart Stone is removed.
W-what could possibly happen?
Which way?
To the left.
It's beautiful!
Take it, Megan.
Ooh.. Maybe I shouldn't.
Go ahead, my dear.
Which way, Your Eminence?
Uh-oh!
Careful, Megan!
GIVE ME MY HEART STONE!
What's the matter with him?!
If His Eminence gets his feelings from the Heart Stone..
..Then without it, he's turning into a major-league grouch!        RUN!
Hurry!
This way.
Hurry!
This way!
Come on, let's go!
Go! That way!
Look!
I've found you! Who wants to be turned to stone first?
You've gone too far this time, Rockdog.
No, Truly!
No, Truly, don't go!
Stay here!
Go ahead.
Huh? "Go ahead?"
What are you talking about?
What's the matter with you?
You really don't like anyone, do you?
I mean it! Go ahead! I don't care what you do with her.
You're crazy if you think I'll buy that.
I'm perfectly serious. I've been surrounded by these romantic idiots for so long, it is refreshing to find  one such as yourself.
Wind Whistler! How could you?
Pay no attention to them, Crunch!
You really don't care what I do to her?
That sentimental fool? Certainly not.
Good, cause I'm gonna turn her to stone!  Haha! I thought so! You DO care, don't you?
Wait! I'll prove I'm on your side!  By giving you your next victim!
Yeah, that's it, Wind Whistler, bring me to him!
The Heart Stone!
Please, Heart Stone, do something!
NO!
It worked!
She's alright!!
Hey you guys, look, it's me!
Hooray, it's Gusty!
I knew you wouldn't turn against us, Wind Whistler.
Yeah, yeah! We're okay, we're okay! Yeah, yeah, fine! I feel good!
Hooray! We found you!
Stop laughing! Stop cheering! Why are you so happy? There's nothing to be happy about! Stop it or I'll  bite ya!
I bet all he needs is a little heart.
Yeah, then he'd be a nice puppy!
Now hold still!
Look..!
I can't believe how happy he looks!
Well, of course he does!
Well, I guess we'd better get this back to His Eminence before he turns into a permanent  grump!
Discovering you have a heart  Makes the gloom in your soul depart ~
It's wonderful to have a heart~! ~
Thank you for all your help! I'm pleased that Crunch now has a heart of his very own.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, Eminence!
Goodbye! Bye bye!
Wind Whistler, er, we're sorry we said you had no feelings.
And we, er, we wanna thank you for doing what you did back there.
Why? Logic alone dictated my actions. It would have been too much trouble to carry three heavy stone statues all the way home.  Just kidding.
