We've gotta get these banners and bows and balloons and things up!
You're certainly on cloud nine today, Truly.
But of course, Paradise! The Big Brother Ponies are comin' home!
Gee, what if the Big Brothers don't make it on time?
Who knows what might have happened to them? And a year's an awfully long time..
You're speaking of the Big Brothers! They'll be here alright! And they'll be on time.
Surprise!!  Hiya Buttons! Wasn't that a good surprise?
Uh, sure! Now help me replace all these 'surprise' balloons!  Do you hear something..?
A bit louder, perhaps..
It sounds like a circus!
Now, Kyrie, sing!
No, Somnambula, please, don't make me!
SING!
Let's see what it is..
Paradise! What are you doing?!  You- aaoh!
But the party!  Oh well, it doesn't matter..
No- Lofty! You can't! The party!  Everybody! PLEASE don't do this!
We're gonna play this when the Big Brothers cross the finish line, so get it right!
You hear somethin'?
I surely do - I hear the sound of y'all not playin'!
That's enough, Kyrie.  Ah, I feel..  ..better already.  Welcome.
We thought we heard.. a circus.
And so you did.  We can go there if you like  All you have to do is follow me
Fourth down and five yards to go, Steamer! We're almost home!
Yeah, and I'm gonna ride all over your rails at the finish line, Score!
Ah, just think, Salty! In a few moments, we'll see Paradise Estate again! Ah, after all  this time..
Aye, matey! We'll hoist our jim and lay ha-hard into port!
Uh... right.
Reckon you're lookin' forward to seein' them  lil' fillies when we get home, eh Slugger?
Yep.
Especially that there Buttons, huh?
Yep..
Hm.. sure hope she can improve your talkin' abilities some!  Yee-haw! Gonna bust your chops, Score!
It ain't a touchdown 'til you pass the goalpost, Tex!
Ho-ho-ho, blow me down!
Where IS everybody?
Maybe they forgot we was comin'?
Ah, not the Little Ponies!
N-not Buttons!
They'd never forget!
I've got it! This is all a gag! All we gotta do is walk through  that door, and they'll all jump out yelling "surprise!".
It's the Big Brothers y'all!
Ah, you can jump out and surprise us now
Anybody home?
Ahoy?
There is something seriously wrong here.  Who could imagine we'd return after all this time to find Paradise Estate abandoned?  Devoid of life? Silent!
You're here!
You're here!
Hooray!
Me hap-py!
What happened to everybody?
They heard the sound of a circus!
And they all just up and left!
Like they were in some kind of trance or something! I heard it, but it didn't bother me.
Me heard it too, but no make me go.
Hm. It sounds like it affects JUST the Little Ponies, and not the babies!
And not baby dragons!
What d'you think we should do?
I think Truly and the others should wait here!  While we go find 'em!
They're just so dashing.
And brave.
Oh, I do hope they can rescue the others..
Ah.. I can feel my powers increasing already!  Now I can make all this real!
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, here it is! The wonder kitchen, bake to your heart's content!  Step right up, folks! The gardener's delight!
Oh boy, seeds!
Ice cream, ladies and gents! All you can eat!
I'll have one of each!
We've been following the Ponies' tracks all day without a sign of 'em!
And it's getting dark! We're gonna have to bed down soon.
N-no! We keep searching!
No way, Slugger! Why, in five minutes, you won't be able to see your own nose!
Now, Kyrie - sing for me!
No, Somnambula! It's not right!
I have the power to make my illusions real now!
Uh- ah- alright, alright!
TRULY!  Come on! We've gotta stop her!  Hurry! Oh, Truly, wake up!  Oh no!
Not Big Brothers too!
We gotta break their trance somehow!  Oh, I hate to do this, but.. LET 'EM HAVE IT!
What in the sam hill..?
What're we doin' here?
Somebody knocked us off the tracks!
It was us!
What's that singin'?
It's funny singing!
It makes all the grown-up ponies act strange! Even Big Brothers, like they walkin' in sleep!
Where's it coming from?
Right there!
Slugger! What're you doing?!
Truly!
Ah! Oh, !
Come back!!
Ah, you okay good buddy?
Yep, I-I think so..
THAT'S where we've gotta go!
Looks a mite dangerous, Score.
That's where the Little Ponies are, Tex.
That's where Buttons is!
Then that's where we're gonna go!
Now, you lil' 'uns head back up to the hills and stay safe!
Come on, let's see some teamwork!  Now that's what I call teamwork!
Boy howdy..
I'm beginnin' to understand why all the Little Ponies left home!
Maybe. But there's something weird about all this.  Truly! Hey, c'mere, we wanna talk to ya!  Well how d'you like that?
Lickety-Split?
It's us! It's the Big Brother Ponies!
Not now, I've gotta get some more ice cream!
Heart Throb!
No! I am Salome, one of the most famous lovers in history!
Heart Throb, don't you recognize us?
Go away, you're spoiling my performance!
No! You're gonna listen to us!  Heart Throb.. you're so old!
I feel fine! Now get out of here!  I want to be alone.
Gingerbread!
I just gotta find Buttons - I gotta know if she's okay!
That gal's face looked like 40 miles of bad road!
Something is not altogether ship-shape here!
I'll say! We've got to get them out of here now. And we can't let anything stop us!
Woah!
Well shift my gears!
Woah, what a spread!
Ho-ho-ho, blow me down!
Now who could've known that football is my game?
Aye, and there's the fine ship I've always wanted!
Wait a minute, guys! This isn't right! It's too perfect!
Yeah, ain't it just?
So, they won't play, eh?
No! No, don't make me do it Somnambula! What you're doing is evil!
I have my youth back - I have my new powers! YOU don't think I'm going to stop now, do you?!  Now, sing!
No! Don't listen to it..!
All aboard!
Yee-haw, it's round-up time!
Let's burn rubber!
All power back, full speed ahead!
Batter up!  Explaining sports
It's a  run! He's on the 50, the 40, the 30!
I've got to get out of here! I've just got to!  Gotta get out! Gotta get out! Go-  I am out!
Hey, look!
Hey!
Over here!
There she is, here, here!
What d'you want?
Have you seen the ponies?
They're in there, and they're all playing!
What?
Somnambula made me sing them into a trance.
Who's So'nambula?
She's an awful witch, who takes youth for herself and only gives back age.
Y-you put them in a trance?!
Can you put them out of it?
Well, I suppose I could sing a different song, but I'm not going back there! I'm not going anywhere near Somnambula  again!
But you have to help us!
Please!
Help rescue our friends!
Help us! Please!
Okay.. I'll help. Will you come with me?
YES!
Okay, no one's around!
Cover your ears!
The Ponies!  Got to help them!
What am I doin'?!
You came, you rescued us!
Our heroes!
But what's happened to us? We're so old..
Where's Buttons? I can't find her!
Yeah, I haven't seen ANY of the unicorns!
And you won't, either!
4-Speed, Slugger, come with me! The rest of you - protect the Little Ponies!  And bring that bird!
You heard 'im! Let's get down to business!  YEE-HAW!
Let's break it down!  ..Let's try again.
Now you'll know what it's like to have someone gnawin' on you!
Hey, watch where you're goin'!
This is gettin' us nowhere!
We've got to get it open! Remember Slugger - Buttons is probably on the other side!
It's like all their magic powers are being sucked into that crystal!
So.. that's it! Somnambula's been getting her youth from the other ponies, and her new powers from the unicorns!
Quite right, Kyrie!  And I've no intention of giving them up!
Woohoo!
Sing, Kyrie - wake the unicorns up!
But - she can't~!
T-then, I'll stop you myself!
Ah - but you won't.
Buttons!
NO!  NO!!  No..!  No, no!!
Well, tie me up and brand me! Y'all's young again!
And everybody's safe and sound.
What about Slugger?
And Buttons?
Don't worry! They're the safest and soundest of any of us!
Let's hard a-port  and set sail for safe dry-dock!
I've got a better idea, Salty - let's go home instead?
