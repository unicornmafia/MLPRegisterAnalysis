Baby Heart Throb, please, sit down!
Knight Shade, Knight Shade! Woooo!
Do the moonwalk, ponies!
I can't hear a thing! And I can't see, either!
Let me take care of this.  Baby Heart Throb, please, sit down and be quiet!
Well, I guess that cooled her down!
I wasted a perfectly good ice cream cone on you.
Ohhh.. lost ice cream cone.. Lemme get another one for Lickety-Split!
We'll come, too!
But I promised your mothers I'd bring you right back.
Oh, come on, Megan. They'll only be gone a minute.
Well.. okay, but come right back.
Promise!
C'mon, c'mon, hurry hurry hurry!  Oh, my, my... what have we here?  Ah, my fair young maidens, how do you do?
My name is Zeb, what might yours be?
Um, Baby Heart Throb.
Baby Half Note!
Baby Lofty!
Gee, you workin'
Not really.. I'm Knight Shade's personal manager!
Knight Shade?!
My my, you must be fans..! How'd'you like to meet him?
Would we?!
Then, come along, my lovelies, I'll take you to meet the great star himself.
It's a pleasure to meet all of you.
Can we come back and sing tomorrow, Knight Shade?
Oh, sorry. We're moving on right away.
Aww, why you have to go?
Oh, er, tomorrow we have to play in a village  called, er, Rosedale!
Ah, er, Knight Shade, perhaps our new friends like a tour of the campgrounds  before we move on? Ah, er, sorry I can't accompany you, but I've got some 'business'  to attend to..
Well, okay Zeb, we won't take long.
We're gonna have to go get 'em, Molly. The rest of you, wait for us here.
Hi, we're looking for three baby Ponies, have you seen them?
Why, yes, I have; they were here just a little while ago, I sent them home to  their mothers.
You did! Oh, good. Thanks for your help.
No problem ...no problem at all.
They went back to Paradise Estate.
What? Where's my ice cream cone?!
Never mind, Lickety-Split. Come on, guys, let's go make sure the babies got home alright.
So, what do you think of our little set-up, eh?
Nice, very nice!
Say, you three don't have any musical talents yourselves, do you?
Oh, I do! Wanna be backup singer for Knight Shade!
No kidding.. You want to sing backup for Knight Shade.
Well, I'm very flattered.
Baby Half Note sing better than Baby Heart Throb!
That was very nice!  But, wouldn't you be better  off trying it together? Rather than as rivals?
See how much better you can do when you work together? So, you wanna join the tour,  huh?
Make up your minds quickly, we're getting ready to move on!
YES!!
They're not here and they're not in the nursery.. Where can they be?
I don't know, but here come Heart Throb and Lofty. We've got to tell them.
Tell us what?
That.. the babies are gone.
The babies?!
Take it easy, Heart Throb.  You mean you lost them at the concert?
Let me explain while we go back to look for them.
Megan, what do you think has happened to our babies?
Do you think they could have been kidnapped by Knight Shade?
That monster! I'm going to go after him right now!
No, Lofty. We'll have a better chance of finding them if we go back to  Paradise Estate and organize search parties.
That's right, the Baby Ponies are missing, but we're going to find them.  Lofty, why don't you lead the main search party? Okay, Whizzer, you can carry  messages.  Now, Galaxy, you come with us. Fizzy, you go with the other group.
That was great! Why don't you take a break?
Woah..!
You alright, Baby Half Note?
Feel kinda dizzy..
You've probably just had a little too much excitement for one day.
Oh, y-yeah, yeah, Zeb, that's right, uh, maybe you'd all better take a nap.
Don't feel so good myself..
Me either..
Look sick!
All pale!
Like ghosts!  Feel sick.. too sick to fly.
Baby Lofty, Baby Lofty, your shadow! Your shadow is gone!  All shadows gone!  Where's shadows?
Hello! I'm Camembert, the Mayor of Muensterville. How can I help you?
Hello, Mr. Bert. We're looking for a musician called Knight Shade.
Knight Shade, you say.. Knight Shade, Knight Shade..
Well, have you seen him?
Possibly, possibly..
Yes or no? We really need to know where he is.
Well, you're NOT going to find out!
Oh, how will we ever find our babies now?!
What's wrong?
You tricked us! Stole shadows! Not our friend! Made us sick! Now give  shadows back!
Baby Lofty right!
No, no.. Knight Shade no thief!
Ah, well, uh..
Somebody stole your shadows, eh? That's some joke!
No joke! Is true!
You laugh, we go home.
Where you goin', babies?
You know, you shouldn't be out after dark, alone..
Yeaaah. Somethin' baaad might happen to ya!
Never see other ponies again...
Maybe they look for us right now?
Let us out of here!
We've got to find our babies!
Save your breath. They won't let us go.
But we didn't DO anything!
Didn't do anything? You've done plenty! Or rather, your friend Knight  Shade did. We don't know what's wrong, but we're not gonna let you do  that to the rest of us!
But Knight Shade is not our friend!
So you say...
Say.. I've got it! Mr. Mayor, look at the sick children. They cast no shadows!  That's the reason they're sick. Knight Shade must have stolen their shadows!
That makes sense. No doubt they feel empty and incomplete. The loss of their  shadows being an outward sign of some loss of substance.
Please, Mr. Mayor, you must let us go. What happened to your children could  be happening to the Baby Ponies right now. We MUST be free to stop this  Knight Shade!
Well, perhaps I will let you go.
But, Sheriff Ricotta and I will go with you. You'll need our help to get  past our nasty cousins, the Roadies!
Nobody comin' to save us..
Where grown-ups?
Can't give up! Hey.. let's sing!
I wonder where the Baby Ponies could be?
Our babies!
The coast is clear!
There!
We're so glad we've found you. But you're so pale!
We're sick..
Knight Shade stole shadows..
Well, he's not gonna get away with it. We're going to make him give those  shadows back!
There he is! Let's go after him!
Where?
He's on his way to his trailer.
Let's go get him!
What IS that in the mirror?
It looks as if that looking-glass could use a good cleaning to me.
You fiend!
You'd better give our babies' back their shadows or else!
We're gonna make you pay for what you did to our children!
Yep!
Yeah!
We've gotta catch Knight Shade!
Or we'll never get our babies' shadows!  Look at that!
Oh- uh-  I- I didn't wanna do it! I  didn't wanna do it!
Then why did you?!
He MADE me do it!
Who?
Erebus! He's a wizard. He looks like a big, gray storm cloud.
That must be the thing we saw in the mirror!
Yes! That's how he gives me my orders!
What kind of orders?
To steal shadows for him! Although Zeb is the one who actually steals 'em.  He puts them in his satchel.
You mean, the babies' shadows are in the satchel he was carrying?
Yeah, that's right!
And we let him get away... Was he taking them to Erebus?
Yeah! So you see, I couldn't give back your babies' shadows - I haven't got 'em!
What does Erebus do with the shadows?
I don't know exactly, but they give him power. Power which he uses to make me  do what he wants!
You see, I come from Grayvale, a place that used to be called  Bright Valley. I tried my best as a singer there, but nobody came to see me.  I was ready to give up, then Erebus came along. He said he was a wizard and  promised to make me a star! All he said he wanted in return.. was a little  co-operation. The first concert he promoted in Bright Valley was a smash! Everyone  in town was there!
And while I was singing, Erebus had Zeb steal everyone's shadow -  including my own mother's.  When I saw what Erebus had done, I refused to work for him any more, and I  demanded that he give everyone their shadows back! But he threatened to steal  my shadow..
..and he laughed at me. I didn't know then that the shadows  provided Erebus with energy that gave him his magical powers! And he used the  energy from the shadows to make himself into this huge cloud of energy! I don't  know how he does that - it's a closely guarded secret. I'm not even sure Zeb  knows. Then Erebus made me take my act on the road, and he sent Zeb along to do  the shadow stealing! And as I became famous, more fans came to see me, Zeb stole  more shadows and Erebus became even more powerful! His hunger for power is endless!  And I'm forced to help Zeb supply him with more and more shadows. If I don't help him,  he'll steal my shadow, which would end my career. But worse, it would mean that I'd  never have any hope of restoring Grayvale - and my mother - to the way they used to be.
Pleaaase let him go, he didn't really wanna hurt us!
What do you think?
Poor creature didn't have any choice, did he?
Thank you, Baby Heart Throb. Y'know.. you're so lucky to have loved ones who  care about you so much. I have a wonderful mother - but she-  she has to  live with the terrible shame of what I've done, to her AND Grayvale.
I think we oughtta help Knight Shade.
You mean we should fight Erebus ourselves?
Exactly! That's the only way we'll ever get the babies' shadows back!
AND our children's shadows, too!
Yup.
And my mothers, and the rest of Grayvale's!
Well, what are we waiting for, guys? Knight Shade, show us the way to Grayvale!
Alright! Yeah! Yaaay!
Where is everybody?
I think they must be in hiding.
Knight Shade...
Knight Shade...
Knight Shade!
You've got a lot of nerve coming back here, Knight Shade.
And you'll be sorry you did...
There's gotta be a way out! Keep looking!
- I'm afraid we're doomed!
Stop this! Please!  My son..
Mother, can you ever forgive me for what I've done?
You're my son, I love you. Nothing could ever change that.
Please! Leave my son and his friends alone!
I didn't expect them to hate me so much.
What else did you expect from them, my son? You haven't earned their  trust. And Erebus possesses their spirit and courage.
Not for long, he doesn't.
Yes, Master, Knight Shade has done well.  I suggest we roll out the red carpet and give them all a welcome they'll never  forget.
Capital idea, capital!
Ah, my boy... You've done well. This is a fine assortment of shadows.  Mmm, very fine indeed.
Surprise, Erebus! As of right now, I quit helping you steal shadows!
You can't mean that! I make you what you are!
That's right, you did. But now I'm making my own decisions!
That's right, not only is he quitting, but we want everyone's shadow back and  we want them back NOW.
I can't afford to let you turn on me, Knight Shade. You and your friends will pay dearly!
The master said you'd pay...  ..and now, it's time for me to collect.
I'll take care of Zeb! Find that satchel!
Okay, Knight Shade!
You fool, you're out of your league here!
The satchel should be in one of these rooms.
We can't help running!
What'll we do?
The bushes, quick!
Hm? Ah, hahahaha! You can run, my little friends, but you can't hide!
Split up and hide!
It's our only chance!
There's the satchel!  Got it! Now let's go find the others.
You girls oughtta watch where you're going!
Come on, Molly, we've gotta stop him!
Oh, darlings! I'm so sorry! Are you both alright?
We're fine. Have you seen Erebus?
Seen him? Seen him? My darlings, we've been trying to stay  away from him!
Galaxy, use your light!
No you won't!  Zeb? Zeb, quickly! Bring the satchel!
Keep back!
Mm..
I hunger, Zeb! Feed me!
My pleasure, master!
Let's get Galaxy to safety.
So the Shadow Satchel seems to be the source of Erebus' power!
And the longer Erebus chased after us, and used up his energy, the smaller he  became!
That's right! So we if we can keep him exerting himself long enough, we  should be able to beat him.
But we need an army for that.
Well, that's kind of what I had in mind.
Quickly, I need more! That one pony shadow wasn't enough!  I need more and I need it now!
But master, there isn't any more. And without Knight Shade there's no way to lure people  to us!
I don't care, Zeb!  I need more shadows, or I'll take yours!
Yes, yes..
Now!
Oh, come on, I need your help.
Now remember..
I know, I know, it's important..
Now remember, Lofty. Stay low until you get out of Grayvale. We can't risk  Erebus spotting you.  We're counting on you!
Lofty, shouldn't we stay lower?
You're right, Molly.
Woah!
See, it's just so hard flying like this.
Lofty, help!
What a lovely little girl. Your shadow is just right for my collection!
NO!
While they're playing , I'll just take your shadow!
Woah..!
Woah!  That was close.
Hold on, we've got a long way to go.
Megan, there's no point in talking to the Grayvalians. They hate me!
You're wrong, Knight Shade. We need them to get the Baby Ponies' shadows back! GRAYVALIANS! Together,  we can overcome Erebus and Zeb!
Why should we help you, when you stand with the very one who stole  our shadows?!
Because our loved ones have lost their shadows, and we want to save them!
We trusted him before, and he betrayed our trust!
If you don't trust me, trust Megan and the Ponies! They-
No! Go! And leave us alone! There's nothing we can do.
No shadows? You let them get away?  I must have more shadows! Only Knight Shade can get me all the shadows I need!
I will not fail you again, Erebus!
We've got to get the Shadow Satchel away from Zeb!
He and Erebus are gonna come looking for us,  because we're the only ones around with shadows! So when they come,  we can be waiting for them!
I'll stay here with Lickety-Split and Knight Shade and try to get them from behind, okay?  You and the sheriff can circle through the woods.
We'd better do SOMETHING! They're here!
Now's our chance!
There they are, Zeb!  Return to me, Knight Shade, and I'll forgive you!
You can't fool me any more, Erebus! I'll never return! And I WON'T let you  hurt my friends!
Surrender, Knight Shade, you and your friends can't stop us!
You must return to me. Your friends cannot protect you!  Now feed me! Give me that shadow now!
Going someplace?  Zeb's waitin' for ya!
Leave this place, Erebus!
Listen to him, Zeb - he's giving me orders!
Such rudeness, and after everything you've done for him, too.
You should have stuck with me, my boy! I would have made you famous, and you could  have supplied me with shadows.
Spare him!
A mother's love! How touching!  Knight Shade, you don't want your  mother to suffer, do you?
Hey, Boss, we got 'em! Aww, we got the big Cheesies, hurr hurr..
Seize them!
Oh..!
Mother!
Knight Shade, you know I'm the only one that has really had the power to do anything for you!  Remember the fame? The adoring fans?
It's not worth it any more, Erebus.
You're a real fool. Zeb! Another shadow. This time, get his friend, who thinks she's been  hiding from us in the bushes.
Knight Shade!
I'll just take your shadow.
No!
Go away, don't bother me.
YOU! Because of you and your friend, Knight Shade turned against me! Soon you'll join  him in his torment!
I have a surprise for you, Erebus.  The Flutter Ponies! They're  to defeat you!
ZEB! Zeb! The satchel, use it!
EREBUS! HELP ME!
The shadows are returning!
They're getting their shadows!
Shadows!!
To think that those pathetic creatures caused such problems.
But it'll never happen again. And we have Knight Shade to thank for that! Three  cheers for Knight Shade!
Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!
I don't deserve your cheers. I just hope you'll forget what I did, and forgive me.
Knight Shade wonderfulest, bravest hero ever.
