(Note that many of the ponies listed above only appeared in the background, and did not have speaking parts in 
 this episode. I just listed them all cause I'm a completist like that :p)

** As with all of my transcripts, this is not intended to be a replacement for watching 
the episode itself, it's more for quoting purposes, easily checking lines without having to 
search through the episode for them, etc. **

Notes: 
- As with most episodes of MLP 'n Friends, this episode was shown in parts (four 
  parts, in this ep's case). So when I refer to parts, that's what I'm talking about :P.
- Many people spell Erebus' name as "Arabus". The way his name is pronounced, it 
  could go either way, but I'm sticking with the spelling "Erebus" as I believe he 
  was named to reference this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erebus
- Knight Shade's name is spelt as both "Knight Shade" and "Night Shade" in the episode; 
  I went with the former spelling for this transcript since it appears more often than 
  the latter.
- The Baby Ponies speak in a very broken, childish way - any missing words in their 
  dialogue are (probably! ^^;) meant to be missing. Just to clarify ^^.

------------

(At the Baby Bonnet School of Dance, Megan, Molly, Lickety-Split and babies Lofty, 
 Heart Throb and Half Note are at a Knight Shade concert. Cue the first insert song, 
 "Moonwalk Ponies".)

[Knight Shade] ~ I'm a talkin' little pony
                 Knight Shade is my name
                 You say you'd like to meet me
                 I'd say that's a shame

                 Cause if your feet won't moonwalk.. ~

(The Baby Ponies are jumping up and down excitedly, particularly Baby Heart Throb, 
 as Knight Shade continues singing in the background.)

[Megan] Baby Heart Throb, please, sit down!
[Baby Heart Throb] Knight Shade, Knight Shade! Woooo!
(Lickety-Split crosses her arms irritably.)
[Knight Shade] (in the background) ~ Do the moonwalk, ponies! ~
[Lickety-Split] I can't hear a thing! And I can't see, either!
[Megan] (to Lickety-Split) Let me take care of this. 
        Baby Heart Throb, please, sit down and be quiet!
(Baby Heart Throb ignores her; Megan just kind of shrugs at Lickety-Split, who glares at her, then 
 leans forward and nudges Megan's ice cream cone out of her hand. It lands on Baby Heart 
 Throb's head, effectively shutting her up.)
[Knight Shade] ~ Do the moonwalk, ponies!
                 Put that sparkle in your shoes~!
                 Do the moonwalk! ~
[Lickety-Split] (laughing) Well, I guess /that/ cooled her down!

~~~

(Some time later, the ponies, Megan and Molly are leaving the concert.)

[Lickety-Split] (to Baby Heart Throb) I wasted a perfectly good ice cream cone on you.
[Baby Heart Throb] Ohhh.. lost ice cream cone.. Lemme get another one for Lickety-Split!
(She turns and walks away; the other two Baby Ponies follow her.)
[Baby Half Note] We'll come, too!
(Megan and Molly exchange looks.)
[Megan] But I promised your mothers I'd bring you right back..
[Molly] Oh, come on, Megan. They'll only be gone a minute.
[Megan] (glances at her watch) Well.. okay, but come right back.
[Baby Heart Throb] Promise!

~~~

(An anthropomorphic, shady-looking zebra dude is hanging around backstage, talking 
 to an anthro rat, who's loading boxes into a truck. The zebra - Zeb - has a smooth, 
 kind of Southern accent.)

[Zeb] C'mon, c'mon, hurry hurry hurry!
(He notices the Baby Ponies...)
      Oh, my, my... what have we here?
(They approach him, and he bows.)
      Ah, my fair young maidens, how do you do?
[Baby Heart Throb] (giggles)
[Zeb] My name is Zeb, what might yours be?
(The Baby Ponies look at Zeb, clearly entranced.)
[Baby Heart Throb] (gulps) Um, Baby Heart Throb.
[Baby Half Note] Baby Half Note!
[Baby Lofty] Baby Lofty!
[Baby Heart Throb] Gee, you workin' (shell?)
[Zeb] Not really.. I'm Knight Shade's personal manager!
[Baby Ponies] (gasp excitedly) Knight Shade?!
[Zeb] My my, you must be /fans/..! How'd'you like to meet him?
[Baby Half Note] Would we?!
[Zeb] Then, come along, my lovelies, I'll take you to meet the great star himself.

~~~

(In Knight Shade's trailer.)

[Knight Shade] It's a pleasure to meet all of you.
[Baby Half Note] Can we come back and sing tomorrow, Knight Shade?
[Knight Shade] (shakes head) Oh, sorry. We're moving on right away.
[Baby Lofty] Aww, why you have to go?
[Knight Shade] (looks shifty, glances at Zeb) Oh, er, tomorrow we have to play in a village 
               called, er, Rosedale!
[Zeb] Ah, er, Knight Shade, perhaps our new friends like a /tour/ of the /campgrounds/ 
      before we move on? Ah, er, sorry I can't accompany you, but I've got some 'business'
      to attend to.. 
(He winks at Knight Shade.)
[Knight Shade] (hesitantly) Well, okay Zeb, we won't take long.
(The Baby Ponies rush out of Knight Shade's trailer happily; he turns and smirks at Zeb.)

~~~

(Back at the Baby Bonnet School of Dance...)

[Megan] (sigh) We're gonna have to go get 'em, Molly. The rest of you, wait for us here.

~~~

(In Knight Shade's trailer, Zeb is sitting, counting money. He hears a knock at the door, smirks, 
 and opens it. Megan and Molly are standing outside.)
[Megan] Hi, we're looking for three baby Ponies, have you seen them?
[Zeb] Why, yes, I /have/; they were here just a little while ago, I sent them home to 
      their mothers. (points towards Paradise Estate)
[Megan] (relieved) You did! Oh, good. Thanks for your help.
[Zeb] No problem..
(Megan and Molly leave.)
      (laughs; speaks under his breath) ...no problem at all.

(Megan and Molly walk over to Lickety-Split, Buttons and Shady.)
[Megan] They went back to Paradise Estate.
[Lickety-Split] What? Where's my ice cream cone?!
[Megan] Never mind, Lickety-Split. Come on, guys, let's go make sure the babies got home alright.
(She, Molly and the Ponies leave for Paradise Estate.)

~~~

(Aaaand back at Knight Shade's trailer again, the Baby Ponies and Knight Shade are 
 walking back into the trailer.)

[Zeb] So, what do you think of our little set-up, eh?
[Baby Half Note] Nice, very nice!
[Zeb] Say, you three don't have any musical talents yourselves, do you?
[Baby Heart Throb] Oh, I do! Wanna be backup singer for Knight Shade!
(Baby Lofty and Baby Half Note giggle.)
[Zeb] No kidding.. You want to sing backup for Knight Shade.
(Baby Heart Throb nods eagerly.)
[Knight Shade] Well, I'm very flattered. 
[Baby Half Note] Baby Half Note sing better than Baby Heart Throb! 
(She starts dancing around in a circle, and sings the musical solfege slightly off-key:) 
                 ~ Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-tiiiii-tiii-dooooo! ~
[Knight Shade] That was very nice! (exchanges a glance with Zeb) But, wouldn't you be better 
               off trying it together? Rather than as rivals?
(The Baby Ponies look at each other, then sing:)
[Baby Ponies] ~ Bright lights, how we love bright lights
                Bright lights, how we love bright lights ~
[Knight Shade] See how much better you can do when you work together? So, you wanna join the tour, 
               huh?
[Zeb] Make up your minds quickly, we're getting ready to move on!
[Baby Ponies] (excitedly) YES!!

~~~

(Megan and Molly walk out of Lullabye Nursery sadly.)
[Molly] They're not here and they're not in the nursery.. Where can they be?
[Megan] I don't know, but here come Heart Throb and Lofty. We've got to tell them.
[Lofty] Tell us what?
[Megan] That.. the babies are gone.
[Heart Throb] The babies?! (freaks out)
[Lofty] Take it easy, Heart Throb. (to Megan) You mean you lost them at the concert?
[Megan] (shakes head) Let me explain while we go back to look for them.

~~~

(They return to the Baby Bonnet School of Dance, only to find it deserted - Zeb and Knight Shade 
 have gone.)

[Heart Throb] Megan, what do you think has happened to our babies?
[Megan] Do you think they could have been kidnapped by Knight Shade?
[Lofty] That monster! I'm going to go after him right now! 
(She starts walking away.)
[Megan] No, Lofty. We'll have a better chance of finding them if we go back to 
        Paradise Estate and organize search parties. 

~~~

(At Paradise Estate, the Little Ponies are gathered around Megan and Molly.)

[Megan] That's right, the Baby Ponies /are/ missing, but we're going to find them.
        Lofty, why don't you lead the main search party? Okay, Whizzer, you can carry 
        messages.
        Now, Galaxy, you come with us. Fizzy, you go with the other group. 

~~~

(Elsewhere, Knight Shade and Zeb have set up camp. Inside a tent, the Baby Ponies are 
 on a little stage, dancing and singing this episode's second insert song, "Bright Lights", 
 for Knight Shade and Zeb. During this song, Knight Shade uses his magical satchel 
 to steal their shadows; the Baby Ponies get more and more tired throughout the 
 song. :<)

[Baby Heart Throb] ~ Bright lights, how I love bright lights
                     Pretty to see, shine one on me! ~ 
[Baby Half Note] ~ Bright lights, how I love bright lights
                   All in a row, look how they glow!
[Baby Lofty] ~ It's so much fun, I like it a lot
               Singing and dancing, up here in the spot ~
[All] ~ Bright lights, how we love bright lights
        We all agree, all us three ~
[Baby Heart Throb] ~ It's bright lights... ~
[Baby Half Note] ~ Bright lights... ~
[Baby Lofty] ~ Bright lights..! ~
[All] ~ For me~!
        Dee-da-lee-dee, dee-da-lee-dee, dee-dee..
        Bright lights, dee-da-lee-dee, dee-da-lee-dee..
        Bright lights... ~

(The Baby Ponies gasp and pant, clearly worn out.)

[Knight Shade] That was great! Why don't you take a break?
(Baby Half Note tries to walk off the stage, but trips and goes flying, landing on 
 her face.)
[Baby Half Note] Woah..!
[Knight Shade] You alright, Baby Half Note?
[Baby Half Note] Feel kinda dizzy..
[Zeb] You've probably just had a little too much excitement for one day.
(He gives Knight Shade a meaningful look.)
[Knight Shade] Oh, y-yeah, yeah, Zeb, that's right, uh, maybe you'd all better take a nap.
(The Baby Ponies wander off tiredly.)
[Baby Heart Throb] Don't feel so good myself..
[Baby Lofty] Me either..
(They pass by some mirrors, and look into them.)
[Baby Heart Throb] (surprised) Look sick!
[Baby Half Note] All pale!
[Baby Lofty] Like ghosts!
(They walk out of the tent)
             Feel sick.. too sick to fly.
(She attempts to fly anyway, and Baby Heart Throb and Half Note realize something's wrong - 
 she casts no shadow.)
[Baby Half Note] Baby Lofty, Baby Lofty, your shadow! Your shadow is gone!
                 (looks around, realizes) All shadows gone! (gasps) Where's shadows?

~~~

(Meanwhile, Megan, Galaxy, Lickety-Split, Heart Throb and Lofty are in a nearby 
 town, looking for the Baby Ponies. They notice a crowd of anthropomorphic mice; 
 a sharply-dressed mouse steps forward.)

[Camembert] Hello! I'm Camembert, the Mayor of Muensterville. How can I help you?
[Megan] Hello, Mr. Bert. We're looking for a musician called Knight Shade.
(Camembert glances at a police officer - Sheriff Ricotta - standing behind him.)
[Camembert] (thoughtfully) Knight Shade, you say.. Knight Shade, Knight Shade..
(He walks away; Megan and the Little Ponies follow him.)
[Megan] Well, have you seen him?
[Camembert] Possibly, possibly..
(They continue onto a little platform of sorts, which is quickly revealed to be a 
 giant mousetrap.)
[Megan] Yes or no? We really need to know where he is.
[Camembert] Well, you're NOT going to find out!
(He pulls a lever, trapping the ponies and Megan in the mousetrap.)
[Megan and Ponies] (gasp, then scream)
[Heart Throb] (to Lofty) Oh, how will we ever find our babies now?!

~~~

(Back at Knight Shade's camp, the Baby Ponies are still looking for their shadows. 
 Zeb and Knight Shade and walk out of the tent together.)

[Knight Shade] What's wrong?
[Baby Ponies] (crying)
[Baby Lofty] You tricked us! Stole shadows! Not our friend! Made us sick! Now give 
             shadows back!
[Baby Half Note] Baby Lofty right!
[Baby Heart Throb] No, no.. Knight Shade no thief!
[Knight Shade] Ah, well, uh..
[Zeb] (laughs) Somebody stole your shadows, eh? That's some joke!
[Baby Lofty] No joke! Is true!
[Baby Half Note] You laugh, we go home.

(They run for it, only for one of Zeb's lackeys - an anthro rat, or Roadie - to 
 run in front of them, blocking their path.)

[Roadie #1] (menacingly) Where you goin', babies?
[Baby Ponies] (gasp)
(Another Roadie sneaks up behind them, trapping them.)
[Roadie #2] (laughs) You know, you shouldn't be out after dark, alone..
(The Baby Ponies run away while he's distracted; however, a third Roadie blocks 
 their way.)
[Roadie #3] (laughs) Yeaaah. Somethin' baaad might happen to ya!
[Baby Ponies] (gasp again)
(They try to run for it again, only for the first two Roadies to throw a net over 
 them. Cut to the Baby Ponies, trapped in a cage.)
              (sniffling and crying)

(End of part one.)

~~~

(Beginning of part two; the Baby Ponies are still in the cage.)

[Baby Heart Throb] (crying) Never see other ponies again... (sniffle)
[Baby Lofty] Maybe they look for us right now?

~~~

(Back in Muensterville..)

[Lofty] Let us out of here!
[Heart Throb] We've got to find our babies!
[Megan] Save your breath. They won't let us go.
[Molly] But we didn't DO anything!
[Camembert] Didn't do anything? You've done plenty! Or rather, your friend Knight 
            Shade did. We don't know what's wrong, but we're not gonna let you do 
            that to the rest of us!
[Megan] But Knight Shade is /not/ our friend! 
[Camembert] So you say...
[Megan] Say.. I've got it! Mr. Mayor, look at the sick children. They cast no shadows!
        That's the reason they're sick. Knight Shade must have stolen their shadows!
[Galaxy] That makes sense. No doubt they feel empty and incomplete. The loss of their 
         shadows being an outward sign of some loss of substance. 
[Lofty] Please, Mr. Mayor, you must let us go. What happened to /your/ children could 
        be happening to the Baby Ponies right now. We MUST be free to stop this 
        Knight Shade!
[Camembert] Well, perhaps I will let you go.
[Ponies, Megan and Molly] (cheer)
[Camembert] But, Sheriff Ricotta and I will go with you. You'll need our help to get 
            past our nasty cousins, the Roadies!
(The trap lifts, freeing Megan, Molly and the ponies.)

~~~

(Over at Knight Shade's camp, the Baby Ponies are now imprisoned in a cage inside 
 a trailer.)

[Baby Ponies] (crying)
[Baby Heart Throb] Nobody comin' to save us..
[Baby Lofty] Where grown-ups?
[Baby Half Note] Can't give up! Hey.. let's sing!
[Baby Ponies] (crying)

(Megan, Molly, the Little Ponies and the Muensterville mice sneak into the camp.)

[Megan] I wonder where the Baby Ponies could be?
[Baby Ponies] (still crying)
[Heart Throb] Our babies!
[?] The coast is clear!

(They rush over to the caravan, and find the Baby Ponies in the cage. Lofty glares 
 at the lock, then kicks it off.)

[Lofty] There! 
[Megan] We're so glad we've found you. But you're so pale!
[Baby Heart Throb] We're sick..
[Baby Lofty] Knight Shade stole shadows..
[Megan] Well, he's not gonna get away with it. We're going to make him give those 
        shadows back!
[Molly] (looking out of the trailer's window) There he is! Let's go after him!
[Megan] Where?
[Molly] He's on his way to his trailer.
[Lofty] Let's go get him!

(They all sneak out over to Knight Shade's trailer, and look in through the window. 
 Knight Shade is sitting at his dressing table, looking into the mirror; a smoky 
 figure is inside the mirror. Zeb is standing behind Knight Shade, leering at the 
 mirror.)
[Megan] What IS that in the mirror?
[Heart Throb] It looks as if that looking-glass could use a good cleaning to me.
(Zeb picks up a satchel and walks out of the trailer. Megan, Lofty, Heart Throb and 
 the Muensterville mice rush in, and up to Knight Shade, who's clearly shocked.)
[Heart Throb] You fiend!
[Lofty] You'd better give our babies' back their shadows or else!
[Camembert] We're gonna make you pay for what you did to our children!
[Sheriff Ricotta] Yep!
[Ponies] Yeah! (noises of agreement, etc)
(Panicking, Knight Shade turns and kicks the mice away with his hind legs; they go 
 flying, landing on the ponies. Knight Shade runs away in the ensuing confusion.)
[Megan] We've gotta catch Knight Shade!
[Lofty] Or we'll never get our babies' shadows!

(Knight Shade continues to run; Lofty and Heart Throb fly after him. They notice some rope 
 lying on the ground nearby.)

        Look at that!

(They grab the rope and tie Knight Shade up. The ponies, Megan and the mice stand around 
 Knight Shade, glaring at him.)

[Knight Shade] Oh- uh- (struggling noises, then starts crying) I- I didn't wanna do it! I 
               didn't wanna do it!
[Megan] Then why did you?!
[Knight Shade] He MADE me do it!
[Megan] Who?
[Knight Shade] Erebus! He's a wizard. He looks like a big, gray storm cloud. 
[Megan] That must be the thing we saw in the mirror!
[Knight Shade] Yes! That's how he gives me my orders!
[Megan] What kind of orders?
[Knight Shade] To steal shadows for him! Although Zeb is the one who actually steals 'em. 
               He puts them in his satchel.
[Megan] You mean, the babies' shadows are in the satchel he was carrying?
[Knight Shade] Yeah, that's right!
[Megan] And we let him get away... Was he taking them to Erebus?
[Knight Shade] Yeah! So you see, I couldn't give back your babies' shadows - I haven't got 'em!
[Lofty] What does Erebus do with the shadows?
[Knight Shade] I don't know exactly, but they give him power. Power which he uses to make me 
               do what he wants!

(cue flashback)

[Knight Shade] (voice-over) You see, I come from Grayvale, a place that used to be called 
               Bright Valley. I tried my best as a singer there, but nobody came to see me. 
               I was ready to give up, then Erebus came along. He said he was a wizard and 
               promised to make me a star! All he said he wanted in return.. was a little 
              co-operation. The first concert he promoted in Bright Valley was a smash! Everyone 
              in town was there!
[Bright Valley citizens] (cheering)
[Knight Shade] (voice-over) And while I was singing, Erebus had Zeb steal everyone's shadow - 
               including my own mother's.
               When I saw what Erebus had done, I refused to work for him any more, and I 
               demanded that he give everyone their shadows back! But he threatened to steal 
               /my/ shadow..
[Erebus] (evil laugh)
[Knight Shade] (voice-over) ..and he laughed at me. I didn't know then that the shadows 
               provided Erebus with energy that gave him his magical powers! And he used the 
               energy from the shadows to make himself into this huge cloud of energy! I don't 
               know how he does that - it's a closely guarded secret. I'm not even sure /Zeb/ 
               knows. Then Erebus made me take my act on the road, and he sent Zeb along to do 
               the shadow stealing! And as I became famous, more fans came to see me, Zeb stole 
               more shadows and Erebus became even more powerful! His hunger for power is endless! 
               And I'm forced to help Zeb supply him with more and more shadows. If I don't help him, 
               he'll steal /my/ shadow, which would end my career. But worse, it would mean that I'd 
               never have any hope of restoring Grayvale - and my mother - to the way they used to be.
[Baby Heart Throb] Pleaaase let him go, he didn't really wanna hurt us!
[Lofty] What do you think?
[Heart Throb] Poor creature didn't have any choice, did he?
(She and Lofty rush forward and untie Knight Shade; he approaches the Baby Ponies.)
[Knight Shade] Thank you, Baby Heart Throb. Y'know.. you're so lucky to have loved ones who 
               care about you so much. I have a wonderful mother - but she- (sniffle) she has to 
               live with the terrible shame of what I've done, to her AND Grayvale.
[Baby Ponies] (crying)
[Megan] I think we oughtta help Knight Shade.
[Molly] You mean we should fight Erebus ourselves?
[Megan] Exactly! That's the only way we'll ever get the babies' shadows back!
[Camembert] AND our children's shadows, too!
(Note that in this scene, a random Muensterville citizen is drawn in place of Sheriff 
 Ricotta. I'm attributing the following line to him since it was clearly meant to be him 
 speaking. ^^;)
[Sheriff Ricotta] (sniffle) Yup.
[Knight Shade] And my mothers, and the rest of Grayvale's!
[Megan] Well, what are we waiting for, guys? Knight Shade, show us the way to Grayvale!
[Ponies] Alright! Yeah! Yaaay! (etc)

~~~

(They wander around the empty streets of the dark and dreary town that is Grayvale.)

[Megan] Where is everybody?
[Knight Shade] I think they must be in hiding.
(A Grayvalian looks through a window, glaring.)
[Grayvalian #1] Knight Shade...
(The ponies, Megan and Knight Shade cross a bridge; a second Grayvalian walks out from under it.)
[Grayvalian #2] Knight Shade...
(In a lonely graveyard..)
[Grayvalian #3] Knight Shade!

(The Grayvalians come out of hiding and surround Knight Shade, Megan, Molly and the ponies completely.)
[Megan, Molly, Ponies and Knight Shade] (gasp)
[Grayvalian #4] You've got a lot of nerve coming back here, Knight Shade.
[Grayvalian #5] (menacingly) And you'll be sorry you did...

(Cue this episode's third insert song, the deliciously creepy angry mob song, "We're Gonna 
 Make You Sorry". During this song, the Grayvalians chase the ponies, Megan, Molly, 
 Knight Shade and the Muensterville mice into a corner.)

[Grayvalians] ~ We're gonna make you sorry
                We're gonna kick up a fuss!
                We're gonna make you sorry you tangled with us ~

[Grayvalian #6] ~ We'll make you regret the day you stole our shadows away ~
[Grayvalian #5] ~ You chose a nasty game to play ~
[Grayvalian #7] ~ And now we're gonna make you pa-a-a-a-y! ~

[Grayvalians] ~ We're gonna make you sorry
                We're gonna do it to you
                We're gonna make you sorry
                And when we are through
                No one in this world will be as gloomy and forlorn ~
[Grayvalian #6] ~ We're gonna make you sorry ~
[Grayvalian #5] ~ You wanna know how sorry? ~
[Grayvalian #8] ~ You're gonna be real sorry! ~
[Grayvalians] ~ Sorry you were ever born...
                Sorry you were ever born...
                You'll be sorry you were ever born! ~

(End of part two.)

~~~

(Beginning of part three.)

[Megan] There's gotta be a way out! Keep looking!
[Heart Throb] (?) - I'm afraid we're doomed!
[Grayvalians] (whinny menacingly)
[Knight Shade's mother] Stop this! Please!
(She stands in between the Grayvalians and Knight Shade.)
                        (tearfully) My son.. 
[Knight Shade] Mother, can you ever forgive me for what I've done?
[Knight Shade's mother] You're my son, I love you. Nothing could ever change that.
(They nuzzle each other, sniffling slightly.)
[Ponies] (sniffle)
[Knight Shade's mother] (to the Grayvalians) Please! Leave my son and his friends alone!
(The Grayvalians retreat.)
[Knight Shade] I didn't expect them to hate me so much.
[Knight Shade's mother] What else did you expect from them, my son? You haven't earned their 
                        trust. And Erebus possesses their spirit and courage.
[Knight Shade] (determinedly) Not for long, he doesn't.

~~~

(Cut to an elaborate-looking mansion on a hill above Grayvale; Erebus' house. The group 
 approach it.)

[Erebus] (evil laugh)
(He and Zeb are inside the mansion, watching the ponies through an enchanted mirror.)
         It seems we're about to receive some company, eh Zeb?
[Zeb] Yes, Master, Knight Shade /has/ done well.
(Zeb turns to Erebus.)
      I suggest we roll out the red carpet and give them all a welcome they'll never 
      forget.
[Erebus] (evil laugh) Capital idea, capital! (laughs)

(And thus begins the fourth insert song, a villain song: "Nothing Quite Like Shadows". 
 It's.. um.. pirate-y. :D Very catchy, even if it's not exactly what you'd expect a 
 villain song to be like. ^^; This song always makes me smile, it's so silly. During 
 this song, Zeb and Erebus leave the mansion to, er, 'greet' the ponies.)

        ~ Haha! Hee hee! Do you see what I see?
          A bunch of lovely shadows for the satchel and me ~
[Zeb] ~ Haha! Hoo hoo! There's more than just a few
        I see some pony shadows, plus a pair of humans too! ~ 
[Erebus] ~ I'll bet they're tasty shadows
           They look so dull and grey ~
[Zeb] ~ There's nothing quite like shadows ~
[Both] ~ To brighten up your day! ~

[Erebus] ~ I'll bet they're tasty shadows
           They look so dull and grey ~
[Zeb] ~ There's nothing quite like shadows ~
[Both] ~ To brighten up your day! ~

[Erebus] ~ Haha! ~
[Zeb] ~ Tra la! ~
[Both] ~ We had been feeling "blah"
         But seeing all those shadows makes us wanna shout "hoorah!" ~
[Erebus] ~ Yippee! ~
[Zeb] ~ Hoorah! ~
[Both] ~ Sis boom bah! ~
[Erebus] ~ Yippee! ~
[Zeb] ~ Hoorah! ~
[Both] ~ Sis boom bah~! ~
       (laugh)

[Erebus] (to Knight Shade) Ah, my boy... You've done well. This is a fine assortment of shadows.
         (licks lips) Mmm, very fine indeed. 
[Knight Shade] Surprise, Erebus! As of right now, I quit helping you steal shadows!
[Erebus] (taken aback) You can't mean that! I make you what you are!
(He leans forward; Knight Shade and the rest of the group back away slightly.)
[Knight Shade] That's right, you did. But now I'm making my own decisions!
[Molly] That's right, not only is he quitting, but we want everyone's shadow back and 
        we want them back NOW.
(Erebus is clearly losing his patience with the situation; Zeb retreats while he's 
 distracted. Steam literally starts coming out of Erebus' nostrils.)
[Erebus] I can't afford to let you turn on me, Knight Shade. You and your friends will pay dearly!
(He starts huffing and puffing, literally blowing them away; a gust of wind comes from 
 his mouth [if that.. makes sense.. ^^;]. They crash into a nearby fountain; Knight Shade, Megan 
 and Molly fall into it. The rest of the group flees as they climb out of the fountain.)
[Zeb] The master said you'd pay...
(He walks out from behind a bush, holding the satchel.)
      ..and now, it's time for me to collect.
(Knight Shade rushes forward, head-butting Zeb and knocking the satchel flying out of his.. er.. hooves.
 Knight Shade picks it up himself; Zeb tries to get it and accidentally falls on top of Knight Shade, knocking the 
 satchel out of his mouth and into Erebus' mansion.)
[Knight Shade] I'll take care of Zeb! Find that satchel!
[Megan] Okay, Knight Shade!
(She and Molly run in after the satchel; Zeb tries to run after them, but Knight Shade trips him over. He 
 then tries to run after them himself, only for Zeb to knock *him* over ^^; Zeb stands up and walks 
 over to Knight Shade.)
[Zeb] You fool, you're out of your league here! 

(Megan and Molly rush through the house, coming across a long corridor, with many doors.)
[Megan] The satchel should be in one of these rooms.

(Meanwhile, outside, the Muensterville mice and the Little Ponies are still running 
 from Erebus.)
[Lickety-Split] We can't help running!
[Heart Throb] What'll we do?
[Camembert] The bushes, quick!
(They hide in the bushes, watching Erebus as he rounds the corner, looking for them. He 
 floats around, confused - and then notices some stray leaves on the ground, right in front 
 of the bushes.)
[Erebus] Hm? Ah, hahahaha! You can run, my little friends, but you can't hide!
(He turns into a tornado and blows the bushes away, revealing the ponies and mice.)
[Ponies] (surprised noises)
(Erebus turns back to normal.)
[Erebus] (pants)
[Camembert] Split up and hide!
[Lofty] It's our only chance!
(They run for it; the ponies run into one room, the mice into another.)

(Inside the mansion..)

[Megan] There's the satchel! 
(She and Molly run forward into the room containing the satchel; she picks it up.)
        Got it! Now let's go find the others.
(As they leave the room, Zeb sticks out his.. hoof and trips them; the satchel falls 
 into his arms.)
[Zeb] You girls oughtta watch where you're going! (chuckles)
[Megan] Come on, Molly, we've gotta stop him!
(They run after him, only to run into Heart Throb as they both round a corner at the same 
 time.)
[Heart Throb] Oh, darlings! I'm so sorry! Are you both alright?
[Megan] We're fine. Have you seen Erebus?
[Heart Throb] (in disbelief) Seen him? /Seen him?/ My darlings, we've been trying to stay 
              /away/ from him!
(Just as she says this, the ponies and Muensterville mice run down the corridor, followed by 
 Erebus. Galaxy slips and falls; Erebus closes in on her.)
[Megan, Molly and Heart Throb] (gasp)
[Megan] Galaxy, use your light!
(Galaxy tries to use her unicorn magic, but fails. Megan walks forward, trying to protect 
 Galaxy, but Erebus slams his hand down in between them.)
[Erebus] (to Megan) No you won't!
(He looks down the corridor, somewhat worried.)
         Zeb? Zeb, quickly! Bring the satchel!
(Zeb walks into view, holding the satchel. The ponies and the Muensterville mice are at the 
 other end of the corridor; Camembert is standing in front of them, his arms spread out wide to 
 protect them.)
[Camembert] Keep back!
(Galaxy tries to stand up; however, it's too late. Zeb opens the satchel.)
[Galaxy] Mm.. (screams) 
(But to no avail; her shadow is stolen, too. Erebus shrinks slightly, running out of 
 power.)
[Erebus] I hunger, Zeb! Feed me!
[Zeb] My pleasure, master!
(He opens the satchel; Galaxy's shadow flies around Erebus, supplying him with more 
 power. The ponies, Megan, Molly and the mice gather around Galaxy.)
[Megan] Let's get Galaxy to safety.

~~~

(In what appears to be an underground cave of some sort..)

[Megan] So the Shadow Satchel seems to be the source of Erebus' power!
[Molly] And the longer Erebus chased after us, and used up his energy, the smaller he 
        became!
[Megan] That's right! So we if we can keep him exerting himself long enough, we 
        should be able to beat him.
[Knight Shade] But we need an army for that.
[Megan] Well, that's kind of what I had in mind.

~~~

(Back in the mansion~)

[Erebus] (somewhat weakly) Quickly, I need more! That one pony shadow wasn't enough!
         I need more and I need it /now/!
[Zeb] But master, there isn't any more. And without Knight Shade there's no way to lure people 
      to us!
[Erebus] I don't care, Zeb! 
(He pulls Zeb closer, so they're face-to-face.)
         I need more shadows, or I'll take /yours/!
[Zeb] (freaked out) Yes, yes..
[Erebus] Now!
(Zeb walks out of the room, shutting the door behind him. The Roadies are leaning against 
 the wall.)
[Roadies] (laugh)
[Zeb] Oh, come on, I need your help.

~~~

(The ponies, Megan, Molly, Knight Shade and his mother are standing at the mouth of the cave; 
 Megan is helping Molly get on Lofty's back.)

[Megan] (to Molly) Now remember..
[Molly] I know, I know, it's /important/..
[Megan] Now remember, Lofty. Stay low until you get out of Grayvale. We can't risk 
        Erebus spotting you.
(Lofty and Molly fly away.)
        (calling after them) We're counting on you!

[Molly] Lofty, shouldn't we stay lower?
[Lofty] You're right, Molly.
(She flies lower, into a forest.)
[Molly] (caught off-guard) Woah!
[Lofty] See, it's just so hard flying like this.
(The Roadies are hiding in the trees, waiting for them. They catch Molly by the arms with 
 their long tails, pulling her up towards them.)
[Molly] (screams) Lofty, help!
[Lofty] (gasps) 
[Zeb] What a lovely little girl. Your shadow is just right for my collection! (laughs)

(He opens the satchel, as Molly watches, helpless and terrified. End of part three.)

~~~

(Beginning of part four.)

[Zeb] (laughs)
[Lofty] NO!
(She rushes towards Zeb, but two Roadies jump down from the trees, landing on top of her. She 
 bucks back and forth, trying to knock them off.)
[Zeb] While they're playing (?), I'll just take your shadow!
[Roadies] Woah..!
(Lofty flies under a tree branch; the Roadies are caught on it and fall off her back. Zeb 
 walks towards Molly's shadow; Lofty flies forward and knocks him over. One of the Roadies holding 
 Molly jumps after her; Molly falls out of his grasp.)
[Molly] Woah!
(Luckily, Lofty manages to catch Molly on her back.)
        That was close.
[Lofty] Hold on, we've got a long way to go.

~~~

(Megan, Lickety-Split, the Muensterville mice, Knight Shade and his mother stand on a cliff over-looking 
 Grayvale.)

[Knight Shade] Megan, there's no point in talking to the Grayvalians. They hate me!
[Megan] You're wrong, Knight Shade. We need them to get the Baby Ponies' shadows back! GRAYVALIANS! Together, 
        we can overcome Erebus and Zeb!
[Grayvalian #9] Why should we help you, when you stand with the very one who stole 
                our shadows?!
[Megan] Because /our/ loved ones have lost /their/ shadows, and we want to save them!
[Grayvalian #9] We trusted him before, and he betrayed our trust!
[Knight Shade] If you don't trust me, trust Megan and the Ponies! They-
[Grayvalian #9] No! Go! And leave us alone! There's nothing we can do.

~~~

(Cut back to Erebus' mansion.)
[Erebus] (incredulously/angrily, to a Roadie) No shadows? You let them get away?
         I must have more shadows! Only Knight Shade can get me all the shadows I need!
[Zeb] I will not fail you again, Erebus!

~~~

(Back in the cave..)

[Megan] We've got to get the Shadow Satchel away from Zeb!
[Camembert] He and Erebus are gonna come looking for us, (gestures to him and Sheriff 
            Ricotta) because we're the only ones around with shadows! So when they come, 
            we can be waiting for them!
[Megan] I'll stay here with Lickety-Split and Knight Shade and try to get them from behind, okay? 
        You and the sheriff can circle through the woods.
[Lickety-Split] We'd better do SOMETHING! They're here!

(The group walk out of the cave.)

[Camembert] (to Sheriff Ricotta) Now's our chance! 
(They leave, rushing through the forest and hiding behind a tree.)

[Erebus] There they are, Zeb! 
(Erebus and Zeb go past the mice, and up to the mouth of the cave.)
         Return to me, Knight Shade, and I'll forgive you!
[Knight Shade] You can't fool me any more, Erebus! I'll never return! And I WON'T let you 
               hurt my friends!
(Knight Shade launches himself forward, head-butting Zeb, who pushes him away.)
[Zeb] Surrender, Knight Shade, you and your friends can't stop us!
(He opens the Shadow Satchel and steals Lickety-Split's shadow.)
[Ponies] (dismayed noises)
[Erebus] You must return to me. Your friends cannot protect you!
         (turns to Zeb) Now feed me! Give me that shadow now!
(Zeb does so, and Erebus regains more of his energy...)

(In the woods, the Muensterville mice are still hiding behind the tree..)

[Roadie #1] Going someplace?
(Pan up to reveal that the Roadies are still lying in wait in the trees; they lean down, 
 leering at Camembert and Sheriff Ricotta.)
            Zeb's waitin' for ya!
(The Roadies jump down, chasing after their cousins.)
[Roadies] (laugh)

(And back at the cave mouth.)

[Knight Shade] Leave this place, Erebus!
[Erebus] Listen to him, Zeb - /he's/ giving /me/ orders!
[Zeb] Such rudeness, and after everything you've done for him, too.
(Erebus shoots a lightning bolt at Megan and Knight Shade; they dodge it quickly. Megan jumps 
 into a nearby bush; Knight Shade cannot escape, as Erebus keeps shooting lightning bolts at him.)
[Erebus] You should have stuck with me, my boy! I would have made you famous, and you could 
         have supplied me with shadows.
(Knight Shade's mother rushes in front of him, shielding him.)
[Knight Shade's mother] Spare him! 
[Erebus] (laughs, rolls his eyes) A mother's love! How touching! (laugh) Knight Shade, you don't want your 
         /mother/ to suffer, do you? (laughs again)
[Roadie #1] Hey, Boss, we got 'em! 
(The Roadies rush forward, revealing they've captured the Muensterville mice, their hands tied up 
 with the Roadies' tails.)
            (laugh) Aww, we got the big Cheesies, hurr hurr.. 
[Erebus] Seize them!
(The Roadies grab hold of Knight Shade and his mother.)
[Knight Shade's mother] Oh..!
[Knight Shade] Mother!
[Erebus] Knight Shade, you know I'm the only one that has really had the power to do anything for you! 
         Remember the fame? The adoring fans? 
[Knight Shade] (shakes head) It's not worth it any more, Erebus. 
[Erebus] You're a real fool. Zeb! Another shadow. This time, get his friend, who thinks she's been 
         hiding from us in the bushes.
(Megan stands up, glaring at them, hands on hips. Knight Shade struggles, then pulls away from the 
 Roadies and rushes forward.)
[Erebus] Knight Shade!
(He shoots lightning bolts at Knight Shade again, who ignores them and keeps running forward.)
[Zeb] I'll just take your shadow.
(Knight Shade jumps at Zeb, but falls backwards.)
[Knight Shade's mother] No!
(Knight Shade gets up again, and stands on his back hooves, trying to grab the satchel away from Zeb, who 
 simply pushes him away.)
[Zeb] Go away, don't bother me.
[Erebus] (to Megan) YOU! Because of you and your friend, Knight Shade turned against me! Soon you'll join 
         him in his torment!
[Megan] I have a surprise for you, Erebus.
(cut to reveal that the "army" Molly and Lofty had sent for is none other than...)
        The Flutter Ponies! They're (??) to defeat you!

(And thus starts the fifth insert song, the incredibly awesome "We Are The Flutter Ponies". During 
 this song, the Flutter Ponies tie up the Roadies, save the Muensterville Mice, and Utter Flutter 
 Zeb and Erebus - who don't manage to land a hit on them *once* during this song - into submission.
 The Flutter Ponies are friggin' awesome. :D)

[Flutter Ponies] ~ We are the Flutter Ponies
                   Better run and hide
                   We can zig and zag and zoom
                   Up and down and side to side

                   We are the Flutter Ponies
                   Now you've met your match
                   Faster than a lightning bolt
                   We're impossible to catch!

                   Too bad for you, we found you
                   For soon and we surround you
                   Your powers will melt away like butter
                   Doesn't help to fume and sputter
                   Nothing can withstand our Utter Flutter!

                   Challenge the Flutter Ponies, and you'll meet defeat
                   Onward, onward, Flutter Ponies, victory is sweet
                   Onward, onward, Flutter Ponies, victory is sweet~! ~

(Erebus is completely caught up in the Flutter Ponies' Utter Flutter.)
[Erebus] ZEB! Zeb! The satchel, use it!
(All the shadows Erebus has stolen fly out of him and return to their rightful owners. 
 Zeb, surrounded by Flutter Ponies, opens the satchel; Megan rushes forward to try and 
 take it off him, but he pushes her away. She lands nearby; however, before she can do 
 anything, the Grayvalians sneak up behind Zeb, as he uses the satchel. One of them touches 
 Zeb's shoulder.)
[Zeb] (scared) EREBUS! HELP ME!
[Megan] The shadows are returning! 
[Heart Throb] They're getting their shadows!
(The Baby Ponies' shadows return to them...)
[Baby Ponies] (delighted) Shadows!!
(...and finally, Knight Shade and his mother get their shadows back. They stand, smiling at each other. 
 The Grayvalians surround Zeb, who has no choice but to drop the satchel and run. Rosedust, 
 Honeysuckle and Forget-Me-Not fly after him; meanwhile, Lily, Forget-Me-Not and Honeysuckle 
 [..or at least, two Flutter Ponies with the same colours as them] float nearby Erebus, watching 
 as he shrinks with the loss of his power.)
[Erebus] (yells)
(Completely shrunk, Erebus looks left and right, and tries to escape - but Camembert, who is now 
 much larger than Erebus, steps down on him and picks him up. One of the Grayvalians puts handcuffs 
 around Zeb, who looks mutinous.)

~~~

(Grayvale is now much brighter and not so, well, grey. ^^ It's back to its former glory.)

[Knight Shade's mother] To think that those pathetic creatures caused such problems.
[Grayvalian #10] But it'll never happen again. And we have Knight Shade to thank for that! Three 
                 cheers for Knight Shade!
[Ponies, Megan, Muensterville mice] Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!
[Knight Shade] I don't deserve your cheers. I just hope you'll forget what I did, and forgive me.
[Ponies and Megan] (cheer)
(Lofty and Molly fly into view, landing on the ground nearby. Molly jumps off Lofty's back 
 and rushes over to Megan; they hug.)
[Baby Heart Throb] Knight Shade wonderfulest, bravest hero ever.

~~~

(Back at the Baby Bonnet School of Dance, Knight Shade has another concert going on - but this time, 
 the Baby Ponies are singing back-up. Cue the sixth and final insert song, a reprise of 
 "Moonwalk Ponies".)

[Knight Shade] ~ I'm a talkin' little pony
                 Knight Shade is my name ~
[Baby Ponies] ~ Knight Shade! ~
[Knight Shade] ~ You say you'd like to meet me
                 I'd say that's a shame

                 Cause if your feet won't moonwalk, we'll never be in step ~
[Baby Ponies] ~ We'll never be in step! ~
[Knight Shade] ~ You got to do the moonwalk, because it is so hip!
                 Do the moonwalk, ponies ~
[Baby Ponies] ~ Do the moonwalk..! ~
[Knight Shade] ~ Put that sparkle in your shoes!
                 Do the moonwalk, ponies ~
[Baby Ponies] ~ That's right! ~
[Knight Shade] ~ And you'll never get the blues
                 Move your feet ~
[Baby Ponies] ~ Move your feet! ~
[Knight Shade] ~ Put a.. ~
[Knight Shade and Baby Ponies] ~ ..smile on your face!
                                 Do the moonwalk! ~

~ THE END! ~
