SOURCES and TEXT FORMATTING:

mlpfim: used a PHP program I found here:
https://github.com/juju2143/mlp-transcript-search

which downloads from the mlp wiki:
http://mlp.wikia.com/

Added automated processing for cleanup via a custom-written shell script


mlpaf: downloaded raw transcripts from
http://www.kittieoflife.com/transcripts.htm

these were very messy, so:
 I first edited them by hand to get them into a consistent state
 then I wrote a python program to process the text into dialog and speaker files for analysis


CLEANUP STEPS:
removed all "stage instructions" (text in parenthesis or brackets)
removed all emphasis markers (either ''word'' or /word/)

Format for processing:
dialog: broke into single line per utterance for analysis
speakers: wrote single line per file


ANALYSIS:
I analyzed for the following feature sets:
Number of Words
Normalized Number of Tokens
Number of Sentences
Ave Len of Sentences
Ave Len of Words
POS tags (using the upenn tag set)





FINDINGS:
several of the nominal types were higher for MLPFIM
num tokens and average sentence length are higher for MLPFIM
more interjections in MLPFIM
more adjectives in MLPFIM
more speakers for MLPFIM

several of the verbal types are higher for MLPAF
personal pronouns are higher for MLPAF
more commas (more complexity?) in MLPAF
significantly higher modals in MLPAF


ERRORS:
I took out all of the songs
I think that the higher value of ":" for MLPFIM is an artifact of translator habit/preference
